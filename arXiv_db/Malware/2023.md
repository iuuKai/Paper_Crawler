<summary>2023-01-03 06:45:54 - Boosting Neural Networks to Decompile Optimized Binaries</summary>

- *Ying Cao, Ruigang Liang, Kai Chen, Peiwei Hu*

- `2301.00969v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00969v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00969v1)

> Decompilation aims to transform a low-level program language (LPL) (eg., binary file) into its functionally-equivalent high-level program language (HPL) (e.g., C/C++). It is a core technology in software security, especially in vulnerability discovery and malware analysis. In recent years, with the successful application of neural machine translation (NMT) models in natural language processing (NLP), researchers have tried to build neural decompilers by borrowing the idea of NMT. They formulate the decompilation process as a translation problem between LPL and HPL, aiming to reduce the human cost required to develop decompilation tools and improve their generalizability. However, state-of-the-art learning-based decompilers do not cope well with compiler-optimized binaries. Since real-world binaries are mostly compiler-optimized, decompilers that do not consider optimized binaries have limited practical significance. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based approach named NeurDP, that targets compiler-optimized binaries. NeurDP uses a graph neural network (GNN) model to convert LPL to an intermediate representation (IR), which bridges the gap between source code and optimized binary. We also design an Optimized Translation Unit (OTU) to split functions into smaller code fragments for better translation performance. Evaluation results on datasets containing various types of statements show that NeurDP can decompile optimized binaries with 45.21% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art neural decompilation frameworks.

- *Kshitiz Aryal, Maanak Gupta, Mahmoud Abdelsalam*

- `2301.01044v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01044v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.01044v1)

> With the increase in machine learning (ML) applications in different domains, incentives for deceiving these models have reached more than ever. As data is the core backbone of ML algorithms, attackers shifted their interest toward polluting the training data. Data credibility is at even higher risk with the rise of state-of-art research topics like open design principles, federated learning, and crowd-sourcing. Since the machine learning model depends on different stakeholders for obtaining data, there are no reliable automated mechanisms to verify the veracity of data from each source.   Malware detection is arduous due to its malicious nature with the addition of metamorphic and polymorphic ability in the evolving samples. ML has proven to solve the zero-day malware detection problem, which is unresolved by traditional signature-based approaches. The poisoning of malware training data can allow the malware files to go undetected by the ML-based malware detectors, helping the attackers to fulfill their malicious goals. A feasibility analysis of the data poisoning threat in the malware detection domain is still lacking. Our work will focus on two major sections: training ML-based malware detectors and poisoning the training data using the label-poisoning approach. We will analyze the robustness of different machine learning models against data poisoning with varying volumes of poisoning data.

<summary>2023-01-09 17:26:37 - Efficient Attack Detection in IoT Devices using Feature Engineering-Less Machine Learning</summary>

- *Arshiya Khan, Chase Cotton*

- `2301.03532v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03532v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.03532v1)

> Through the generalization of deep learning, the research community has addressed critical challenges in the network security domain, like malware identification and anomaly detection. However, they have yet to discuss deploying them on Internet of Things (IoT) devices for day-to-day operations. IoT devices are often limited in memory and processing power, rendering the compute-intensive deep learning environment unusable. This research proposes a way to overcome this barrier by bypassing feature engineering in the deep learning pipeline and using raw packet data as input. We introduce a feature engineering-less machine learning (ML) process to perform malware detection on IoT devices. Our proposed model, "Feature engineering-less-ML (FEL-ML)," is a lighter-weight detection algorithm that expends no extra computations on "engineered" features. It effectively accelerates the low-powered IoT edge. It is trained on unprocessed byte-streams of packets. Aside from providing better results, it is quicker than traditional feature-based methods. FEL-ML facilitates resource-sensitive network traffic security with the added benefit of eliminating the significant investment by subject matter experts in feature engineering.

<summary>2023-01-12 14:25:31 - Open SESAME: Fighting Botnets with Seed Reconstructions of Domain Generation Algorithms</summary>

- *Nils Weissgerber, Thorsten Jenke, Elmar Padilla, Lilli Bruckschen*

- `2301.05048v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05048v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.05048v1)

> An important aspect of many botnets is their capability to generate pseudorandom domain names using Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs). A cyber criminal can register such domains to establish periodically changing rendezvous points with the bots. DGAs make use of seeds to generate sets of domains. Seeds can easily be changed in order to generate entirely new groups of domains while using the same underlying algorithm. While this requires very little manual effort for an adversary, security specialists typically have to manually reverse engineer new malware strains to reconstruct the seeds. Only when the seed and DGA are known, past and future domains can be generated, efficiently attributed, blocked, sinkholed or used for a take-down. Common counters in the literature consist of databases or Machine Learning (ML) based detectors to keep track of past and future domains of known DGAs and to identify DGA-generated domain names, respectively. However, database based approaches can not detect domains generated by new DGAs, and ML approaches can not generate future domain names. In this paper, we introduce SESAME, a system that combines the two above-mentioned approaches and contains a module for automatic Seed Reconstruction, which is, to our knowledge, the first of its kind. It is used to automatically classify domain names, rate their novelty, and determine the seeds of the underlying DGAs. SESAME consists of multiple DGA-specific Seed Reconstructors and is designed to work purely based on domain names, as they are easily obtainable from observing the network traffic. We evaluated our approach on 20.8 gigabytes of DNS-lookups. Thereby, we identified 17 DGAs, of which 4 were entirely new to us.

<summary>2023-01-15 07:34:31 - A Review on the effectiveness of Dimensional Reduction with Computational Forensics: An Application on Malware Analysis</summary>

- *Aye Thaw Da Naing, Justin Soh Beng Guan, Yarzar Shwe Win, Jonathan Pan*

- `2301.06031v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06031v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.06031v1)

> The Android operating system is pervasively adopted as the operating system platform of choice for smart devices. However, the strong adoption has also resulted in exponential growth in the number of Android based malicious software or malware. To deal with such cyber threats as part of cyber investigation and digital forensics, computational techniques in the form of machine learning algorithms are applied for such malware identification, detection and forensics analysis. However, such Computational Forensics modelling techniques are constrained the volume, velocity, variety and veracity of the malware landscape. This in turn would affect its identification and detection effectiveness. Such consequence would inherently induce the question of sustainability with such solution approach. One approach to optimise effectiveness is to apply dimensional reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis with the intent to enhance algorithmic performance. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of the application of Principle Component Analysis on Computational Forensics task of detecting Android based malware. We applied our research hypothesis to three different datasets with different machine learning algorithms. Our research result showed that the dimensionally reduced dataset would result in a measure of degradation in accuracy performance.

<summary>2023-01-15 07:52:31 - A New Deep Boosted CNN and Ensemble Learning based IoT Malware Detection</summary>

- *Saddam Hussain Khan, Wasi Ullah*

- `2212.08008v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08008v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08008v3)

> Security issues are threatened in various types of networks, especially in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment that requires early detection. IoT is the network of real-time devices like home automation systems and can be controlled by open-source android devices, which can be an open ground for attackers. Attackers can access the network credentials, initiate a different kind of security breach, and compromises network control. Therefore, timely detecting the increasing number of sophisticated malware attacks is the challenge to ensure the credibility of network protection. In this regard, we have developed a new malware detection framework, Deep Squeezed-Boosted and Ensemble Learning (DSBEL), comprised of novel Squeezed-Boosted Boundary-Region Split-Transform-Merge (SB-BR-STM) CNN and ensemble learning. The proposed STM block employs multi-path dilated convolutional, Boundary, and regional operations to capture the homogenous and heterogeneous global malicious patterns. Moreover, diverse feature maps are achieved using transfer learning and multi-path-based squeezing and boosting at initial and final levels to learn minute pattern variations. Finally, the boosted discriminative features are extracted from the developed deep SB-BR-STM CNN and provided to the ensemble classifiers (SVM, MLP, and AdabooSTM1) to improve the hybrid learning generalization. The performance analysis of the proposed DSBEL framework and SB-BR-STM CNN against the existing techniques have been evaluated by the IOT_Malware dataset on standard performance measures. Evaluation results show progressive performance as 98.50% accuracy, 97.12% F1-Score, 91.91% MCC, 95.97 % Recall, and 98.42 % Precision. The proposed malware analysis framework is robust and helpful for the timely detection of malicious activity and suggests future strategies

<summary>2023-01-18 07:31:41 - One Size Does not Fit All: Quantifying the Risk of Malicious App Encounters for Different Android User Profiles</summary>

- *Savino Dambra, Leyla Bilge, Platon Kotzias, Yun Shen, Juan Caballero*

- `2301.07346v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07346v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.07346v1)

> Previous work has investigated the particularities of security practices within specific user communities defined based on country of origin, age, prior tech abuse, and economic status. Their results highlight that current security solutions that adopt a one-size-fits-all-users approach ignore the differences and needs of particular user communities. However, those works focus on a single community or cluster users into hard-to-interpret sub-populations.   In this work, we perform a large-scale quantitative analysis of the risk of encountering malware and other potentially unwanted applications (PUA) across user communities. At the core of our study is a dataset of app installation logs collected from 12M Android mobile devices. Leveraging user-installed apps, we define intuitive profiles based on users' interests (e.g., gamers and investors), and fit a subset of 5.4M devices to those profiles. Our analysis is structured in three parts. First, we perform risk analysis on the whole population to measure how the risk of malicious app encounters is affected by different factors. Next, we create different profiles to investigate whether risk differences across users may be due to their interests. Finally, we compare a per-profile approach for classifying clean and infected devices with the classical approach that considers the whole population.   We observe that features such as the diversity of the app signers and the use of alternative markets highly correlate with the risk of malicious app encounters. We also discover that some profiles such as gamers and social-media users are exposed to more than twice the risks experienced by the average users. We also show that the classification outcome has a marked accuracy improvement when using a per-profile approach to train the prediction models. Overall, our results confirm the inadequacy of one-size-fits-all protection solutions.

- *Nidhi Rastogi, Sharmishtha Dutta, Mohammed J. Zaki, Alex Gittens, Charu Aggarwal*

- `2102.05571v6` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05571v6) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05571v6)

> Threat intelligence on malware attacks and campaigns is increasingly being shared with other security experts for a cost or for free. Other security analysts use this intelligence to inform them of indicators of compromise, attack techniques, and preventative actions. Security analysts prepare threat analysis reports after investigating an attack, an emerging cyber threat, or a recently discovered vulnerability. Collectively known as cyber threat intelligence (CTI), the reports are typically in an unstructured format and, therefore, challenging to integrate seamlessly into existing intrusion detection systems. This paper proposes a framework that uses the aggregated CTI for analysis and defense at scale. The information is extracted and stored in a structured format using knowledge graphs such that the semantics of the threat intelligence can be preserved and shared at scale with other security analysts. Specifically, we propose the first semi-supervised open-source knowledge graph-based framework, TINKER, to capture cyber threat information and its context. Following TINKER, we generate a Cyberthreat Intelligence Knowledge Graph (CTI-KG) and demonstrate the usage using different use cases.

<summary>2023-01-20 16:07:26 - StratDef: Strategic Defense Against Adversarial Attacks in ML-based Malware Detection</summary>

- *Aqib Rashid, Jose Such*

- `2202.07568v4` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07568v4) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.07568v4)

> Over the years, most research towards defenses against adversarial attacks on machine learning models has been in the image recognition domain. The malware detection domain has received less attention despite its importance. Moreover, most work exploring these defenses has focused on several methods but with no strategy when applying them. In this paper, we introduce StratDef, which is a strategic defense system based on a moving target defense approach. We overcome challenges related to the systematic construction, selection, and strategic use of models to maximize adversarial robustness. StratDef dynamically and strategically chooses the best models to increase the uncertainty for the attacker while minimizing critical aspects in the adversarial ML domain, like attack transferability. We provide the first comprehensive evaluation of defenses against adversarial attacks on machine learning for malware detection, where our threat model explores different levels of threat, attacker knowledge, capabilities, and attack intensities. We show that StratDef performs better than other defenses even when facing the peak adversarial threat. We also show that, of the existing defenses, only a few adversarially-trained models provide substantially better protection than just using vanilla models but are still outperformed by StratDef.

<summary>2023-01-20 17:39:52 - Blind Spots: Automatically detecting ignored program inputs</summary>

- *Henrik Brodin, Evan Sultanik, Marek Surovič*

- `2301.08700v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08700v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.08700v1)

> A blind spot is any input to a program that can be arbitrarily mutated without affecting the program's output. Blind spots can be used for steganography or to embed malware payloads. If blind spots overlap file format keywords, they indicate parsing bugs that can lead to differentials. This paper formalizes the operational semantics of blind spots, leading to a technique that automatically detects blind spots based on dynamic information flow tracking. An efficient implementation is introduced an evaluated against a corpus of over a thousand diverse PDFs. There are zero false-positive blind spot classifications and the missed detection rate is bounded above by 11%. On average, at least 5% of each PDF file is completely ignored by the parser. Our results show promise that this technique is an efficient automated means to detect parser bugs and differentials. Nothing in the technique is tied to PDF in general, so it can be immediately applied to other notoriously difficult-to-parse formats like ELF, X.509, and XML.

- `2301.11050v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11050v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.11050v1)

> Ransomware is a rapidly evolving type of malware designed to encrypt user files on a device, making them inaccessible in order to exact a ransom. Ransomware attacks resulted in billions of dollars in damages in recent years and are expected to cause hundreds of billions more in the next decade. With current state-of-the-art process-based detectors being heavily susceptible to evasion attacks, no comprehensive solution to this problem is available today. This paper presents Minerva, a new approach to ransomware detection. Unlike current methods focused on identifying ransomware based on process-level behavioral modeling, Minerva detects ransomware by building behavioral profiles of files based on all the operations they receive in a time window. Minerva addresses some of the critical challenges associated with process-based approaches, specifically their vulnerability to complex evasion attacks. Our evaluation of Minerva demonstrates its effectiveness in detecting ransomware attacks, including those that are able to bypass existing defenses. Our results show that Minerva identifies ransomware activity with an average accuracy of 99.45% and an average recall of 99.66%, with 99.97% of ransomware detected within 1 second.

- *Marwan Omar*

> Cyber-crimes have become a multi-billion-dollar industry in the recent years. Most cybercrimes/attacks involve deploying some type of malware. Malware that viciously targets every industry, every sector, every enterprise and even individuals has shown its capabilities to take entire business organizations offline and cause significant financial damage in billions of dollars annually. Malware authors are constantly evolving in their attack strategies and sophistication and are developing malware that is difficult to detect and can lay dormant in the background for quite some time in order to evade security controls. Given the above argument, Traditional approaches to malware detection are no longer effective. As a result, deep learning models have become an emerging trend to detect and classify malware. This paper proposes a new convolutional deep learning neural network to accurately and effectively detect malware with high precision. This paper is different than most other papers in the literature in that it uses an expert data science approach by developing a convolutional neural network from scratch to establish a baseline of the performance model first, explores and implements an improvement model from the baseline model, and finally it evaluates the performance of the final model. The baseline model initially achieves 98% accurate rate but after increasing the depth of the CNN model, its accuracy reaches 99.183 which outperforms most of the CNN models in the literature. Finally, to further solidify the effectiveness of this CNN model, we use the improved model to make predictions on new malware samples within our dataset.

> Neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor poisoning attacks, where the attackers maliciously poison the training set and insert triggers into the test input to change the prediction of the victim model. Existing defenses for backdoor attacks either provide no formal guarantees or come with expensive-to-compute and ineffective probabilistic guarantees. We present PECAN, an efficient and certified approach for defending against backdoor attacks. The key insight powering PECAN is to apply off-the-shelf test-time evasion certification techniques on a set of neural networks trained on disjoint partitions of the data. We evaluate PECAN on image classification and malware detection datasets. Our results demonstrate that PECAN can (1) significantly outperform the state-of-the-art certified backdoor defense, both in defense strength and efficiency, and (2) on real back-door attacks, PECAN can reduce attack success rate by order of magnitude when compared to a range of baselines from the literature.

> Open source intelligence is a powerful tool for cybersecurity analysts to gather information both for analysis of discovered vulnerabilities and for detecting novel cybersecurity threats and exploits. However the scale of information that is relevant for information security on the internet is always increasing, and is intractable for analysts to parse comprehensively. Therefore methods of condensing the available open source intelligence, and automatically developing connections between disparate sources of information, is incredibly valuable. In this research, we present a system which constructs a Neo4j graph database formed by shared connections between open source intelligence text including blogs, cybersecurity bulletins, news sites, antivirus scans, social media posts (e.g., Reddit and Twitter), and threat reports. These connections are comprised of possible indicators of compromise (e.g., IP addresses, domains, hashes, email addresses, phone numbers), information on known exploits and techniques (e.g., CVEs and MITRE ATT&CK Technique ID's), and potential sources of information on cybersecurity exploits such as twitter usernames. The construction of the database of potential IoCs is detailed, including the addition of machine learning and metadata which can be used for filtering of the data for a specific domain (for example a specific natural language) when needed. Examples of utilizing the graph database for querying connections between known malicious IoCs and open source intelligence documents, including threat reports, are shown. We show that this type of relationship querying can allow for more effective use of open source intelligence for threat hunting, malware family clustering, and vulnerability analysis.

> Due to its simple installation and connectivity, the Internet of Things (IoT) is susceptible to malware attacks. Being able to operate autonomously. As IoT devices have become more prevalent, they have become the most tempting targets for malware. Weak, guessable, or hard-coded passwords, and a lack of security measures contribute to these vulnerabilities along with insecure network connections and outdated update procedures. To understand IoT malware, current methods and analysis ,using static methods, are ineffective. The field of deep learning has made great strides in recent years due to their tremendous data mining, learning, and expression capabilities, cybersecurity has enjoyed tremendous growth in recent years. As a result, malware analysts will not have to spend as much time analyzing malware. In this paper, we propose a novel detection and analysis method that harnesses the power and simplicity of decision trees. The experiments are conducted using a real word dataset, MaleVis which is a publicly available dataset. Based on the results, we show that our proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions in that it achieves 97.23% precision and 95.89% recall in terms of detection and classification. A specificity of 96.58%, F1-score of 96.40%, an accuracy of 96.43.

> We present a new algorithm to train a robust malware detector. Modern malware detectors rely on machine learning algorithms. Now, the adversarial objective is to devise alterations to the malware code to decrease the chance of being detected whilst preserving the functionality and realism of the malware. Adversarial learning is effective in improving robustness but generating functional and realistic adversarial malware samples is non-trivial. Because: i) in contrast to tasks capable of using gradient-based feedback, adversarial learning in a domain without a differentiable mapping function from the problem space (malware code inputs) to the feature space is hard; and ii) it is difficult to ensure the adversarial malware is realistic and functional. This presents a challenge for developing scalable adversarial machine learning algorithms for large datasets at a production or commercial scale to realize robust malware detectors. We propose an alternative; perform adversarial learning in the feature space in contrast to the problem space. We prove the projection of perturbed, yet valid malware, in the problem space into feature space will always be a subset of adversarials generated in the feature space. Hence, by generating a robust network against feature-space adversarial examples, we inherently achieve robustness against problem-space adversarial examples. We formulate a Bayesian adversarial learning objective that captures the distribution of models for improved robustness. We prove that our learning method bounds the difference between the adversarial risk and empirical risk explaining the improved robustness. We show that adversarially trained BNNs achieve state-of-the-art robustness. Notably, adversarially trained BNNs are robust against stronger attacks with larger attack budgets by a margin of up to 15% on a recent production-scale malware dataset of more than 20 million samples.

> The popularity and relative openness of Android means it is a popular target for malware. Over the years, various studies have found that machine learning models can effectively discriminate malware from benign applications. However, as the operating system evolves, so does malware, bringing into question the findings of these previous studies, many of which used small, outdated, and often imbalanced datasets. In this paper, we reimplement 16 representative past works and evaluate them on a balanced, relevant and up-to-date dataset comprising 124,000 Android applications. We also carry out new experiments designed to fill holes in existing knowledge, and use our findings to identify the most effective features and models to use for Android malware detection within a contemporary environment. Our results suggest that accuracies of up to 96.8% can be achieved using static features alone, with a further 1% achievable using more expensive dynamic analysis approaches. We find the best models to be random forests built from API call usage and TCP network traffic features.

> The extensive damage caused by malware requires anti-malware systems to be constantly improved to prevent new threats. The current trend in malware detection is to employ machine learning models to aid in the classification process. We propose a new dataset with the objective of improving current anti-malware systems. The focus of this dataset is to improve host based intrusion detection systems by providing API call sequences for thousands of malware samples executed in Windows 10 virtual machines. A tutorial on how to create and expand this dataset is provided along with a benchmark demonstrating how to use this dataset to classify malware. The data contains long sequences of API calls for each sample, and in order to create models that can be deployed in resource constrained devices, three feature selection methods were tested. The principal innovation, however, lies in the multi-label classification system in which one sequence of APIs can be tagged with multiple labels describing its malicious behaviours.

> Certified defenses are a recent development in adversarial machine learning (ML), which aim to rigorously guarantee the robustness of ML models to adversarial perturbations. A large body of work studies certified defenses in computer vision, where $\ell_p$ norm-bounded evasion attacks are adopted as a tractable threat model. However, this threat model has known limitations in vision, and is not applicable to other domains -- e.g., where inputs may be discrete or subject to complex constraints. Motivated by this gap, we study certified defenses for malware detection, a domain where attacks against ML-based systems are a real and current threat. We consider static malware detection systems that operate on byte-level data. Our certified defense is based on the approach of randomized smoothing which we adapt by: (1) replacing the standard Gaussian randomization scheme with a novel deletion randomization scheme that operates on bytes or chunks of an executable; and (2) deriving a certificate that measures robustness to evasion attacks in terms of generalized edit distance. To assess the size of robustness certificates that are achievable while maintaining high accuracy, we conduct experiments on malware datasets using a popular convolutional malware detection model, MalConv. We are able to accurately classify 91% of the inputs while being certifiably robust to any adversarial perturbations of edit distance 128 bytes or less. By comparison, an existing certification of up to 128 bytes of substitutions (without insertions or deletions) achieves an accuracy of 78%. In addition, given that robustness certificates are conservative, we evaluate practical robustness to several recently published evasion attacks and, in some cases, find robustness beyond certified guarantees.

> Several moving target defenses (MTDs) to counter adversarial ML attacks have been proposed in recent years. MTDs claim to increase the difficulty for the attacker in conducting attacks by regularly changing certain elements of the defense, such as cycling through configurations. To examine these claims, we study for the first time the effectiveness of several recent MTDs for adversarial ML attacks applied to the malware detection domain. Under different threat models, we show that transferability and query attack strategies can achieve high levels of evasion against these defenses through existing and novel attack strategies across Android and Windows. We also show that fingerprinting and reconnaissance are possible and demonstrate how attackers may obtain critical defense hyperparameters as well as information about how predictions are produced. Based on our findings, we present key recommendations for future work on the development of effective MTDs for adversarial attacks in ML-based malware detection.

> Hardware-based Malware Detectors (HMDs) have shown promise in detecting malicious workloads. However, the current HMDs focus solely on the CPU core of a System-on-Chip (SoC) and, therefore, do not exploit the full potential of the hardware telemetry. In this paper, we propose XMD, an HMD that uses an expansive set of telemetry channels extracted from the different subsystems of SoC. XMD exploits the thread-level profiling power of the CPU-core telemetry, and the global profiling power of non-core telemetry channels, to achieve significantly better detection performance than currently used Hardware Performance Counter (HPC) based detectors. We leverage the concept of manifold hypothesis to analytically prove the performance gains observed in XMD. We train and evaluate XMD using hardware telemetries collected from 904 benign applications and 1205 malware samples on a commodity Android Operating System (OS)-based mobile device. XMD improves over currently used HPC-based detectors by 32.91% for the in-distribution test data. XMD achieves the best detection performance of 86.54% with a false positive rate of 2.9%, compared to the detection rate of 80\%, offered by the best performing software-based Anti-Virus(AV) on VirusTotal, on the same set of malware samples.

> Recent works have introduced input-convex neural networks (ICNNs) as learning models with advantageous training, inference, and generalization properties linked to their convex structure. In this paper, we propose a novel feature-convex neural network architecture as the composition of an ICNN with a Lipschitz feature map in order to achieve adversarial robustness. We consider the asymmetric binary classification setting with one "sensitive" class, and for this class we prove deterministic, closed-form, and easily-computable certified robust radii for arbitrary $\ell_p$-norms. We theoretically justify the use of these models by characterizing their decision region geometry, extending the universal approximation theorem for ICNN regression to the classification setting, and proving a lower bound on the probability that such models perfectly fit even unstructured uniformly distributed data in sufficiently high dimensions. Experiments on Malimg malware classification and subsets of MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets show that feature-convex classifiers attain state-of-the-art certified $\ell_1$-radii as well as substantial $\ell_2$- and $\ell_{\infty}$-radii while being far more computationally efficient than any competitive baseline.

> Machine learning methods can detect Android malware with very high accuracy. However, these classifiers have an Achilles heel, concept drift: they rapidly become out of date and ineffective, due to the evolution of malware apps and benign apps. Our research finds that, after training an Android malware classifier on one year's worth of data, the F1 score quickly dropped from 0.99 to 0.76 after 6 months of deployment on new test samples.   In this paper, we propose new methods to combat the concept drift problem of Android malware classifiers. Since machine learning technique needs to be continuously deployed, we use active learning: we select new samples for analysts to label, and then add the labeled samples to the training set to retrain the classifier. Our key idea is, similarity-based uncertainty is more robust against concept drift. Therefore, we combine contrastive learning with active learning. We propose a new hierarchical contrastive learning scheme, and a new sample selection technique to continuously train the Android malware classifier. Our evaluation shows that this leads to significant improvements, compared to previously published methods for active learning. Our approach reduces the false negative rate from 16% (for the best baseline) to 10%, while maintaining the same false positive rate (0.6%). Also, our approach maintains more consistent performance across a seven-year time period than past methods.

> Due to the completely open-source nature of Android, the exploitable vulnerability of malware attacks is increasing. Machine learning, leading to a great evolution in Android malware detection in recent years, is typically applied in the classification phase. Since the correlation between features is ignored in some traditional ranking-based feature selection algorithms, applying wrapper-based feature selection models is a topic worth investigating. Though considering the correlation between features, wrapper-based approaches are time-consuming for exploring all possible valid feature subsets when processing a large number of Android features. To reduce the computational expense of wrapper-based feature selection, a framework named DroidRL is proposed. The framework deploys DDQN algorithm to obtain a subset of features which can be used for effective malware classification. To select a valid subset of features over a larger range, the exploration-exploitation policy is applied in the model training phase. The recurrent neural network (RNN) is used as the decision network of DDQN to give the framework the ability to sequentially select features. Word embedding is applied for feature representation to enhance the framework's ability to find the semantic relevance of features. The framework's feature selection exhibits high performance without any human intervention and can be ported to other feature selection tasks with minor changes. The experiment results show a significant effect when using the Random Forest as DroidRL's classifier, which reaches 95.6% accuracy with only 24 features selected.

> Concerns for the resilience of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in critical infrastructure are growing. CPS integrate sensing, computation, control and networking into physical objects and mission-critical services, connecting traditional infrastructure to internet technologies. While this integration increases service efficiency, it has to face the possibility of new threats posed by the new functionalities. This leads to cyber-threats, such as denial-of-service, modification of data, information leakage, spreading of malware, and many others. Cyber-resilience refers to the ability of a CPS to prepare, absorb, recover, and adapt to the adverse effects associated with cyber-threats, e.g., physical degradation of the CPS performance resulting from a cyber-attack. Cyber-resilience aims at ensuring CPS survival, by keeping the core functionalities of the CPS in case of extreme events. The literature on cyber-resilience is rapidly increasing, leading to a broad variety of research works addressing this new topic. In this article, we create a systematization of knowledge about existing scientific efforts of making CPS cyber-resilient. We systematically survey recent literature addressing cyber-resilience with a focus on techniques that may be used on CPS. We first provide preliminaries and background on CPS and threats, and subsequently survey state-of-the-art approaches that have been proposed by recent research work applicable to CPS. In particular, we aim at differentiating research work from traditional risk management approaches, based on the general acceptance that it is unfeasible to prevent and mitigate all possible risks threatening a CPS. We also discuss questions and research challenges, with a focus on the practical aspects of cyber-resilience, such as the use of metrics and evaluation methods, as well as testing and validation environments.

To defend against ever-increasing and ever-evolving malware, tremendous efforts have been made to propose a variety of malware detection that attempt to effectively and efficiently detect malware so as to mitigate possible damages as early as possible. Recent studies have shown that, on the one hand, existing ML and DL techniques enable superior solutions in detecting newly emerging and previously unseen malware.

Then, we conduct a comprehensive and systematic review to categorize the state-of-the-art adversarial attacks against PE malware detection, as well as corresponding defenses to increase the robustness of Windows PE malware detection.

> Be it for a malicious or legitimate purpose, packing, a transformation that consists in applying various operations like compression or encryption to a binary file, i.e. for making reverse engineering harder or obfuscating code, is widely employed since decades already. Particularly in the field of malware analysis where a stumbling block is evasion, it has proven effective and still gives a hard time to scientists who want to efficiently detect it. While already extensively covered in the scientific literature, it remains an open issue especially when considering its detection time and accuracy trade-off. Many approaches, including machine learning, have been proposed but most studies often restrict their scope (i.e. malware and PE files), rely on uncertain datasets (i.e. built based on a super-detector or using labels from an questionable source) and do no provide any open implementation, which makes comparing state-of-the-art solutions tedious. Considering the many challenges that packing implies, there exists room for improvement in the way it is addressed, especially when dealing with static detection techniques. In order to tackle with these challenges, we propose an experimental toolkit, aptly called the Packing Box, leveraging automation and containerization in an open source platform that brings a unified solution to the research community and we showcase it with some experiments including unbiased ground truth generation, data visualization, machine learning pipeline automation and performance of open source packing static detectors.

> With the increase in cybersecurity vulnerabilities of software systems, the ways to exploit them are also increasing. Besides these, malware threats, irregular network interactions, and discussions about exploits in public forums are also on the rise. To identify these threats faster, to detect potentially relevant entities from any texts, and to be aware of software vulnerabilities, automated approaches are necessary. Application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques in the Cybersecurity domain can help in achieving this. However, there are challenges such as the diverse nature of texts involved in the cybersecurity domain, the unavailability of large-scale publicly available datasets, and the significant cost of hiring subject matter experts for annotations. One of the solutions is building multi-task models that can be trained jointly with limited data. In this work, we introduce a generative multi-task model, Unified Text-to-Text Cybersecurity (UTS), trained on malware reports, phishing site URLs, programming code constructs, social media data, blogs, news articles, and public forum posts.

> ML models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial query attacks. In these attacks, queries are iteratively perturbed towards a particular class without any knowledge of the target model besides its output. The prevalence of remotely-hosted ML classification models and Machine-Learning-as-a-Service platforms means that query attacks pose a real threat to the security of these systems. To deal with this, stateful defenses have been proposed to detect query attacks and prevent the generation of adversarial examples by monitoring and analyzing the sequence of queries received by the system. Several stateful defenses have been proposed in recent years. However, these defenses rely solely on similarity or out-of-distribution detection methods that may be effective in other domains. In the malware detection domain, the methods to generate adversarial examples are inherently different, and therefore we find that such detection mechanisms are significantly less effective. Hence, in this paper, we present MalProtect, which is a stateful defense against query attacks in the malware detection domain. MalProtect uses several threat indicators to detect attacks. Our results show that it reduces the evasion rate of adversarial query attacks by 80+\% in Android and Windows malware, across a range of attacker scenarios. In the first evaluation of its kind, we show that MalProtect outperforms prior stateful defenses, especially under the peak adversarial threat.

> Machine Learning (ML) techniques facilitate automating malicious software (malware for short) detection, but suffer from evasion attacks. Many researchers counter such attacks in heuristic manners short of both theoretical guarantees and defense effectiveness. We hence propose a new adversarial training framework, termed Principled Adversarial Malware Detection (PAD), which encourages convergence guarantees for robust optimization methods. PAD lays on a learnable convex measurement that quantifies distribution-wise discrete perturbations and protects the malware detector from adversaries, by which for smooth detectors, adversarial training can be performed heuristically with theoretical treatments. To promote defense effectiveness, we propose a new mixture of attacks to instantiate PAD for enhancing the deep neural network-based measurement and malware detector. Experimental results on two Android malware datasets demonstrate: (i) the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art defenses; (ii) it can harden the ML-based malware detection against 27 evasion attacks with detection accuracies greater than 83.45%, while suffering an accuracy decrease smaller than 2.16% in the absence of attacks; (iii) it matches or outperforms many anti-malware scanners in VirusTotal service against realistic adversarial malware.

> As cyber attacks continue to increase in frequency and sophistication, detecting malware has become a critical task for maintaining the security of computer systems. Traditional signature-based methods of malware detection have limitations in detecting complex and evolving threats. In recent years, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising solution to detect malware effectively. ML algorithms are capable of analyzing large datasets and identifying patterns that are difficult for humans to identify. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art ML techniques used in malware detection, including supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. We also examine the challenges and limitations of ML-based malware detection, such as the potential for adversarial attacks and the need for large amounts of labeled data. Furthermore, we discuss future directions in ML-based malware detection, including the integration of multiple ML algorithms and the use of explainable AI techniques to enhance the interpret ability of ML-based detection systems.

> We identify quantitative characteristics of responses to cyber compromises that can be learned from repeatable, systematic experiments. We model a vehicle equipped with an autonomous cyber-defense system and which also has some inherent physical resilience features. When attacked by malware, this ensemble of cyber-physical features (i.e., "bonware") strives to resist and recover from the performance degradation caused by the malware's attack. We propose parsimonious continuous models, and develop stochastic models to aid in quantifying systems' resilience to cyber attacks.

> Moving Target Defense and Cyber Deception emerged in recent years as two key proactive cyber defense approaches, contrasting with the static nature of the traditional reactive cyber defense. The key insight behind these approaches is to impose an asymmetric disadvantage for the attacker by using deception and randomization techniques to create a dynamic attack surface. Moving Target Defense typically relies on system randomization and diversification, while Cyber Deception is based on decoy nodes and fake systems to deceive attackers. However, current Moving Target Defense techniques are complex to manage and can introduce high overheads, while Cyber Deception nodes are easily recognized and avoided by adversaries.   This paper presents DOLOS, a novel architecture that unifies Cyber Deception and Moving Target Defense approaches. DOLOS is motivated by the insight that deceptive techniques are much more powerful when integrated into production systems rather than deployed alongside them. DOLOS combines typical Moving Target Defense techniques, such as randomization, diversity, and redundancy, with cyber deception and seamlessly integrates them into production systems through multiple layers of isolation. We extensively evaluate DOLOS against a wide range of attackers, ranging from automated malware to professional penetration testers, and show that DOLOS is highly effective in slowing down attacks and protecting the integrity of production systems. We also provide valuable insights and considerations for the future development of MTD techniques based on our findings.

> Deep learning (DL) has proven to be effective in detecting sophisticated malware that is constantly evolving. Even though deep learning has alleviated the feature engineering problem, finding the most optimal DL model, in terms of neural architecture search (NAS) and the model's optimal set of hyper-parameters, remains a challenge that requires domain expertise. In addition, many of the proposed state-of-the-art models are very complex and may not be the best fit for different datasets. A promising approach, known as Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), can reduce the domain expertise required to implement a custom DL model. AutoML reduces the amount of human trial-and-error involved in designing DL models, and in more recent implementations can find new model architectures with relatively low computational overhead.   This work provides a comprehensive analysis and insights on using AutoML for static and online malware detection. For static, our analysis is performed on two widely used malware datasets: SOREL-20M to demonstrate efficacy on large datasets; and EMBER-2018, a smaller dataset specifically curated to hinder the performance of machine learning models. In addition, we show the effects of tuning the NAS process parameters on finding a more optimal malware detection model on these static analysis datasets. Further, we also demonstrate that AutoML is performant in online malware detection scenarios using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for cloud IaaS. We compare an AutoML technique to six existing state-of-the-art CNNs using a newly generated online malware dataset with and without other applications running in the background during malware execution.In general, our experimental results show that the performance of AutoML based static and online malware detection models are on par or even better than state-of-the-art models or hand-designed models presented in literature.

> As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to grow, smartphones have become an integral part of IoT systems. However, with the increasing amount of personal information stored on smartphones, users' privacy is at risk of being compromised by malicious attackers. Malware detection engines are commonly installed on smartphones to defend against these attacks, but new attacks that can evade these defenses may still emerge. In this paper, we present EavesDroid, a new side-channel attack on Android smartphones that allows an unprivileged attacker to accurately infer fine-grained user behaviors (e.g. viewing messages, playing videos) through the on-screen operations. Our attack relies on the correlation between user behaviors and the return values of system calls. The fact that these return values are affected by many factors, resulting in fluctuation and misalignment, makes the attack more challenging. Therefore, we build a CNN-GRU classification model, apply min-max normalization to the raw data and combine multiple features to identify the fine-grained user behaviors. A series of experiments on different models and systems of Android smartphones show that, EavesDroid can achieve an accuracy of 98% and 86% for already considered user behaviors in test set and real-world settings. To prevent this attack, we recommend malware detection, obfuscating return values or restricting applications from reading vulnerable return values.

> Popular messaging applications now enable end-to-end-encryption (E2EE) by default, and E2EE data storage is becoming common. These important advances for security and privacy create new content moderation challenges for online services, because services can no longer directly access plaintext content. While ongoing public policy debates about E2EE and content moderation in the United States and European Union emphasize child sexual abuse material and misinformation in messaging and storage, we identify and synthesize a wealth of scholarship that goes far beyond those topics. We bridge literature that is diverse in both content moderation subject matter, such as malware, spam, hate speech, terrorist content, and enterprise policy compliance, as well as intended deployments, including not only privacy-preserving content moderation for messaging, email, and cloud storage, but also private introspection of encrypted web traffic by middleboxes. In this work, we systematize the study of content moderation in E2EE settings. We set out a process pipeline for content moderation, drawing on a broad interdisciplinary literature that is not specific to E2EE. We examine cryptography and policy design choices at all stages of this pipeline, and we suggest areas of future research to fill gaps in literature and better understand possible paths forward.

> Blockchain has recently been depicted as a secure protocol for information exchange in cyber-physical microgrids. However, it is still found vulnerable to consensus manipulation attacks. These stealth attacks are often difficult to detect as they use kernel-level access to mask their actions. In this paper, we firstly build a trusted and secured peer-to-peer network mechanism for physical DC microgrids' validation of transactions over Distributed Ledger. Secondly, we leverage from a physics-informed approach for detecting malware-infected nodes and then recovering from stealth attacks using a self-healing recovery scheme augmented into the microgrid Blockchain network. This scheme allows compromised nodes to adapt to a reconstructed trustworthy signal in a multi-hop manner using corresponding measurements from the reliable nodes in the network. Additionally, recognizing the possible threat of denial-of-service attacks and random time delays (where information sharing via communication channels is blocked), we also integrate a model-free predictive controller with the proposed system that can locally reconstruct an expected version of the attacked/delayed signals. This supplements the capabilities of Blockchain, enabling it to detect and mitigate consensus manipulation attempts, and network latencies.

> As cyber attacks continue to increase in frequency and sophistication, detecting malware has become a critical task for maintaining the security of computer systems. Traditional signature-based methods of malware detection have limitations in detecting complex and evolving threats. In recent years, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising solution to detect malware effectively. ML algorithms are capable of analyzing large datasets and identifying patterns that are difficult for humans to identify. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art ML techniques used in malware detection, including supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. We also examine the challenges and limitations of ML-based malware detection, such as the potential for adversarial attacks and the need for large amounts of labeled data. Furthermore, we discuss future directions in ML-based malware detection, including the integration of multiple ML algorithms and the use of explainable AI techniques to enhance the interpret ability of ML-based detection systems.

- *Heng Li, Zhang Cheng, Bang Wu, Liheng Yuan, Cuiying Gao, Wei Yuan, Xiapu Luo*

- `2303.08509v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08509v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08509v1)

> The function call graph (FCG) based Android malware detection methods have recently attracted increasing attention due to their promising performance. However, these methods are susceptible to adversarial examples (AEs). In this paper, we design a novel black-box AE attack towards the FCG based malware detection system, called BagAmmo. To mislead its target system, BagAmmo purposefully perturbs the FCG feature of malware through inserting "never-executed" function calls into malware code. The main challenges are two-fold. First, the malware functionality should not be changed by adversarial perturbation. Second, the information of the target system (e.g., the graph feature granularity and the output probabilities) is absent.   To preserve malware functionality, BagAmmo employs the try-catch trap to insert function calls to perturb the FCG of malware. Without the knowledge about feature granularity and output probabilities, BagAmmo adopts the architecture of generative adversarial network (GAN), and leverages a multi-population co-evolution algorithm (i.e., Apoem) to generate the desired perturbation. Every population in Apoem represents a possible feature granularity, and the real feature granularity can be achieved when Apoem converges.   Through extensive experiments on over 44k Android apps and 32 target models, we evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency and resilience of BagAmmo. BagAmmo achieves an average attack success rate of over 99.9% on MaMaDroid, APIGraph and GCN, and still performs well in the scenario of concept drift and data imbalance. Moreover, BagAmmo outperforms the state-of-the-art attack SRL in attack success rate.

- `2207.10242v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10242v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10242v3)

> To enhance the efficiency of incident response triage operations, it is not cost-effective to defend all systems equally in a complex cyber environment. Instead, prioritizing the defense of critical functionality and the most vulnerable systems is desirable. Threat intelligence is crucial for guiding SOC analysts' focus toward specific system activity and provides the primary contextual foundation for interpreting security alerts. This paper explores novel approaches for improving incident response triage operations, including ransomware attacks and zero-day malware. This solution for rapid prioritization of different ransomware has been raised to formulate fast response plans to minimize socioeconomic damage from the massive growth of ransomware attacks in recent years; it can also be extended to other incident responses. To address this concern, we propose a ransomware triage approach that can rapidly classify and prioritize different ransomware classes. We utilize a pre-trained ResNet18 network based on Siamese Neural Network (SNN) to reduce the biases in weight and parameters. In addition, our approach uses the entropy features directly obtained from the binary ransomware files to improve feature representation, resilient to obfuscation noise, and computationally less expensive, which evaluation also shows that this classification part of our proposed approach achieves the accuracy exceeding ....and outperforms other similar classification performance. This new triage strategy based on Task memory with meta-learning evaluates the level of similarity matching across ransomware classes to identify any risky and unknown ransomware (e.g., zero-day attacks) so that a defense of those that support critical functionality can be conducted.

> The cyber-threat landscape has evolved tremendously in recent years, with new threat variants emerging daily, and large-scale coordinated campaigns becoming more prevalent. In this study, we propose CELEST (CollaborativE LEarning for Scalable Threat detection, a federated machine learning framework for global threat detection over HTTP, which is one of the most commonly used protocols for malware dissemination and communication. CELEST leverages federated learning in order to collaboratively train a global model across multiple clients who keep their data locally, thus providing increased privacy and confidentiality assurances. Through a novel active learning component integrated with the federated learning technique, our system continuously discovers and learns the behavior of new, evolving, and globally-coordinated cyber threats. We show that CELEST is able to expose attacks that are largely invisible to individual organizations. For instance, in one challenging attack scenario with data exfiltration malware, the global model achieves a three-fold increase in Precision-Recall AUC compared to the local model. We also design a poisoning detection and mitigation method, DTrust, specifically designed for federated learning in the collaborative threat detection domain. DTrust successfully detects poisoning clients using the feedback from participating clients to investigate and remove them from the training process. We deploy CELEST on two university networks and show that it is able to detect the malicious HTTP communication with high precision and low false positive rates. Furthermore, during its deployment, CELEST detected a set of previously unknown 42 malicious URLs and 20 malicious domains in one day, which were confirmed to be malicious by VirusTotal.

> Malware detection has long been a stage for an ongoing arms race between malware authors and anti-virus systems. Solutions that utilize machine learning (ML) gain traction as the scale of this arms race increases. This trend, however, makes performing attacks directly on ML an attractive prospect for adversaries. We study this arms race from both perspectives in the context of MalConv, a popular convolutional neural network-based malware classifier that operates on raw bytes of files. First, we show that MalConv is vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks: appending a byte-level patch to malware files bypasses detection 94.3% of the time. Moreover, we develop a universal adversarial patch (UAP) attack where a single patch can drop the detection rate in constant time of any malware file that contains it by 80%. These patches are effective even being relatively small with respect to the original file size -- between 2%-8%. As a countermeasure, we then perform window ablation that allows us to apply de-randomized smoothing, a modern certified defense to patch attacks in vision tasks, to raw files. The resulting `smoothed-MalConv' can detect over 80% of malware that contains the universal patch and provides certified robustness up to 66%, outlining a promising step towards robust malware detection. To our knowledge, we are the first to apply universal adversarial patch attack and certified defense using ablations on byte level in the malware field.

> Machine learning models have made many decision support systems to be faster, more accurate, and more efficient. However, applications of machine learning in network security face a more disproportionate threat of active adversarial attacks compared to other domains. This is because machine learning applications in network security such as malware detection, intrusion detection, and spam filtering are by themselves adversarial in nature. In what could be considered an arm's race between attackers and defenders, adversaries constantly probe machine learning systems with inputs that are explicitly designed to bypass the system and induce a wrong prediction. In this survey, we first provide a taxonomy of machine learning techniques, tasks, and depth. We then introduce a classification of machine learning in network security applications. Next, we examine various adversarial attacks against machine learning in network security and introduce two classification approaches for adversarial attacks in network security. First, we classify adversarial attacks in network security based on a taxonomy of network security applications. Secondly, we categorize adversarial attacks in network security into a problem space vs feature space dimensional classification model. We then analyze the various defenses against adversarial attacks on machine learning-based network security applications. We conclude by introducing an adversarial risk grid map and evaluating several existing adversarial attacks against machine learning in network security using the risk grid map. We also identify where each attack classification resides within the adversarial risk grid map.

> Managing the threat posed by malware requires accurate detection and classification techniques. Traditional detection strategies, such as signature scanning, rely on manual analysis of malware to extract relevant features, which is labor intensive and requires expert knowledge. Function call graphs consist of a set of program functions and their inter-procedural calls, providing a rich source of information that can be leveraged to classify malware without the labor intensive feature extraction step of traditional techniques. In this research, we treat malware classification as a graph classification problem. Based on Local Degree Profile features, we train a wide range of Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures to generate embeddings which we then classify. We find that our best GNN models outperform previous comparable research involving the well-known MalNet-Tiny Android malware dataset. In addition, our GNN models do not suffer from the overfitting issues that commonly afflict non-GNN techniques, although GNN models require longer training times.

> This report - a major revision of its previous release - describes a reference architecture for intelligent software agents performing active, largely autonomous cyber-defense actions on military networks of computing and communicating devices. The report is produced by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Research Task Group (RTG) IST-152 "Intelligent Autonomous Agents for Cyber Defense and Resilience". In a conflict with a technically sophisticated adversary, NATO military tactical networks will operate in a heavily contested battlefield. Enemy software cyber agents - malware - will infiltrate friendly networks and attack friendly command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and computerized weapon systems. To fight them, NATO needs artificial cyber hunters - intelligent, autonomous, mobile agents specialized in active cyber defense. With this in mind, in 2016, NATO initiated RTG IST-152. Its objective has been to help accelerate the development and transition to practice of such software agents by producing a reference architecture and technical roadmap. This report presents the concept and architecture of an Autonomous Intelligent Cyber-defense Agent (AICA). We describe the rationale of the AICA concept, explain the methodology and purpose that drive the definition of the AICA Reference Architecture, and review some of the main features and challenges of AICAs.

> To enhance the efficiency of incident response triage operations, it is not cost-effective to defend all systems equally in a complex cyber environment. Instead, prioritizing the defense of critical functionality and the most vulnerable systems is desirable. Threat intelligence is crucial for guiding Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts' focus toward specific system activity and provides the primary contextual foundation for interpreting security alerts.

> Accuracy at the top is a special class of binary classification problems where the performance is evaluated only on a small number of relevant (top) samples. Applications include information retrieval systems or processes with manual (expensive) postprocessing. This leads to minimizing the number of irrelevant samples above a threshold. We consider classifiers in the form of an arbitrary (deep) network and propose a new method DeepTopPush for minimizing the loss function at the top. Since the threshold depends on all samples, the problem is non-decomposable. We modify the stochastic gradient descent to handle the non-decomposability in an end-to-end training manner and propose a way to estimate the threshold only from values on the current minibatch and one delayed value. We demonstrate the excellent performance of DeepTopPush on visual recognition datasets and two real-world applications. The first one selects a small number of molecules for further drug testing. The second one uses real malware data, where we detected 46\% malware at an extremely low false alarm rate of $10^{-5}$.

> There is a growing trend of cyberattacks against Internet of Things (IoT) devices; moreover, the sophistication and motivation of those attacks is increasing. The vast scale of IoT, diverse hardware and software, and being typically placed in uncontrolled environments make traditional IT security mechanisms such as signature-based intrusion detection and prevention systems challenging to integrate. They also struggle to cope with the rapidly evolving IoT threat landscape due to long delays between the analysis and publication of the detection rules. Machine learning methods have shown faster response to emerging threats; however, model training architectures like cloud or edge computing face multiple drawbacks in IoT settings, including network overhead and data isolation arising from the large scale and heterogeneity that characterizes these networks.   This work presents an architecture for training unsupervised models for network intrusion detection in large, distributed IoT and Industrial IoT (IIoT) deployments. We leverage Federated Learning (FL) to collaboratively train between peers and reduce isolation and network overhead problems. We build upon it to include an unsupervised device clustering algorithm fully integrated into the FL pipeline to address the heterogeneity issues that arise in FL settings. The architecture is implemented and evaluated using a testbed that includes various emulated IoT/IIoT devices and attackers interacting in a complex network topology comprising 100 emulated devices, 30 switches and 10 routers. The anomaly detection models are evaluated on real attacks performed by the testbed's threat actors, including the entire Mirai malware lifecycle, an additional botnet based on the Merlin command and control server and other red-teaming tools performing scanning activities and multiple attacks targeting the emulated devices.

> Malware detection has become a major concern due to the increasing number and complexity of malware. Traditional detection methods based on signatures and heuristics are used for malware detection, but unfortunately, they suffer from poor generalization to unknown attacks and can be easily circumvented using obfuscation techniques. In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) and notably Deep Learning (DL) achieved impressive results in malware detection by learning useful representations from data and have become a solution preferred over traditional methods. More recently, the application of such techniques on graph-structured data has achieved state-of-the-art performance in various domains and demonstrates promising results in learning more robust representations from malware. Yet, no literature review focusing on graph-based deep learning for malware detection exists. In this survey, we provide an in-depth literature review to summarize and unify existing works under the common approaches and architectures. We notably demonstrate that Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) reach competitive results in learning robust embeddings from malware represented as expressive graph structures, leading to an efficient detection by downstream classifiers. This paper also reviews adversarial attacks that are utilized to fool graph-based detection methods. Challenges and future research directions are discussed at the end of the paper.

> Cyber resilience is the ability of a system to resist and recover from a cyber attack, thereby restoring the system's functionality. Effective design and development of a cyber resilient system requires experimental methods and tools for quantitative measuring of cyber resilience. This paper describes an experimental method and test bed for obtaining resilience-relevant data as a system (in our case -- a truck) traverses its route, in repeatable, systematic experiments. We model a truck equipped with an autonomous cyber-defense system and which also includes inherent physical resilience features. When attacked by malware, this ensemble of cyber-physical features (i.e., "bonware") strives to resist and recover from the performance degradation caused by the malware's attack. We propose parsimonious mathematical models to aid in quantifying systems' resilience to cyber attacks. Using the models, we identify quantitative characteristics obtainable from experimental data, and show that these characteristics can serve as useful quantitative measures of cyber resilience.

> A blind spot is any input to a program that can be arbitrarily mutated without affecting the program's output. Blind spots can be used for steganography or to embed malware payloads. If blind spots overlap file format keywords, they indicate parsing bugs that can lead to exploitable differentials. For example, one could craft a document that renders one way in one viewer and a completely different way in another viewer. They have also been used to circumvent code signing in Android binaries, to coerce certificate authorities to misbehave, and to execute HTTP request smuggling and parameter pollution attacks. This paper formalizes the operational semantics of blind spots, leading to a technique based on dynamic information flow tracking that automatically detects blind spots. An efficient implementation is introduced and evaluated against a corpus of over a thousand diverse PDFs parsed through MuPDF, revealing exploitable bugs in the parser. All of the blind spot classifications are confirmed to be correct and the missed detection rate is no higher than 11%. On average, at least 5% of each PDF file is completely ignored by the parser. Our results show promise that this technique is an efficient automated means to detect exploitable parser bugs, over-permissiveness and differentials. Nothing in the technique is tied to PDF in general, so it can be immediately applied to other notoriously difficult-to-parse formats like ELF, X.509, and XML.

> The rising use of microservices based software deployment on the cloud leverages containerized software extensively. The security of applications running inside containers as well as the container environment itself are critical infrastructure in the cloud setting and 5G. To address the security concerns, research efforts have been focused on container security with subfields such as intrusion detection, malware detection and container placement strategies. These security efforts are roughly divided into two categories: rule based approaches and machine learning that can respond to novel threats. In this study, we have surveyed the container security literature focusing on approaches that leverage machine learning to address security challenges.

> One of the most elusive types of malware in recent times that pose significant challenges in the computer security system is the kernel-level rootkits. The kernel-level rootkits can hide its presence and malicious activities by modifying the kernel control flow, by hooking in the kernel space, or by manipulating the kernel objects. As kernel-level rootkits change the kernel, it is difficult for user-level security tools to detect the kernel-level rootkits. In the past few years, many approaches have been proposed to detect kernel-level rootkits. It is not much difficult for an attacker to evade the signature-based kernel-level rootkit detection system by slightly modifying the existing signature. To detect the evolving kernel-level rootkits, researchers have proposed and experimented with many detection systems. In this paper, we survey traditional kernel-level rootkit detection mechanisms in literature and propose a structured kernel-level rootkit detection taxonomy. We have discussed the strength and weaknesses or challenges of each detection approach. The prevention techniques and profiling kernel-level rootkit behavior affiliated literature are also included in this survey. The paper ends with future research directions for kernel-level rootkit detection.

> The explosive growth of cyber attacks nowadays, such as malware, spam, and intrusions, caused severe consequences on society. Securing cyberspace has become an utmost concern for organizations and governments. Traditional Machine Learning (ML) based methods are extensively used in detecting cyber threats, but they hardly model the correlations between real-world cyber entities. In recent years, with the proliferation of graph mining techniques, many researchers investigated these techniques for capturing correlations between cyber entities and achieving high performance. It is imperative to summarize existing graph-based cybersecurity solutions to provide a guide for future studies. Therefore, as a key contribution of this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of graph mining for cybersecurity, including an overview of cybersecurity tasks, the typical graph mining techniques, and the general process of applying them to cybersecurity, as well as various solutions for different cybersecurity tasks. For each task, we probe into relevant methods and highlight the graph types, graph approaches, and task levels in their modeling. Furthermore, we collect open datasets and toolkits for graph-based cybersecurity. Finally, we outlook the potential directions of this field for future research.

> The machine learning approach is vital in Internet of Things (IoT) malware traffic detection due to its ability to keep pace with the ever-evolving nature of malware. Machine learning algorithms can quickly and accurately analyze the vast amount of data produced by IoT devices, allowing for the real-time identification of malicious network traffic. The system can handle the exponential growth of IoT devices thanks to the usage of distributed systems like Apache Kafka and Apache Spark, and Intel's oneAPI software stack accelerates model inference speed, making it a useful tool for real-time malware traffic detection. These technologies work together to create a system that can give scalable performance and high accuracy, making it a crucial tool for defending against cyber threats in smart communities and medical institutions.

> Malware detection on binary executables provides a high availability to even binaries which are not disassembled or decompiled. However, a binary-level approach could cause ambiguity problems. In this paper, we propose a new feature engineering technique that use minimal knowledge about the internal layout on a binary. The proposed feature avoids the ambiguity problems by integrating the information about the layout with structural entropy. The experimental results show that our feature improves accuracy and F1-score by 3.3% and 0.07, respectively, on a CNN based malware detector with realistic benign and malicious samples.

> Binary code similarity detection (BCSD) is widely used in various binary analysis tasks such as vulnerability search, malware detection, clone detection, and patch analysis. Recent studies have shown that the learning-based binary code embedding models perform better than the traditional feature-based approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based binary code embedding model named UniASM to learn representations of the binary functions. We design two new training tasks to make the spatial distribution of the generated vectors more uniform, which can be used directly in BCSD without any fine-tuning. In addition, we present a new tokenization approach for binary functions, which increases the token's semantic information and mitigates the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem. We conduct an in-depth analysis of the factors affecting model performance through ablation experiments and obtain some new and valuable findings. The experimental results show that UniASM outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach on the evaluation dataset. The average scores of Recall@1 on cross-compilers, cross-optimization levels, and cross-obfuscations are 0.77, 0.72, and 0.72. Besides, in the real-world task of known vulnerability search, UniASM outperforms all the current baselines.

> Machine Learning (ML) techniques can facilitate the automation of malicious software (malware for short) detection, but suffer from evasion attacks. Many studies counter such attacks in heuristic manners, lacking theoretical guarantees and defense effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a new adversarial training framework, termed Principled Adversarial Malware Detection (PAD), which offers convergence guarantees for robust optimization methods. PAD lays on a learnable convex measurement that quantifies distribution-wise discrete perturbations to protect malware detectors from adversaries, whereby for smooth detectors, adversarial training can be performed with theoretical treatments. To promote defense effectiveness, we propose a new mixture of attacks to instantiate PAD to enhance deep neural network-based measurements and malware detectors. Experimental results on two Android malware datasets demonstrate: (i) the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art defenses; (ii) it can harden ML-based malware detection against 27 evasion attacks with detection accuracies greater than 83.45%, at the price of suffering an accuracy decrease smaller than 2.16% in the absence of attacks; (iii) it matches or outperforms many anti-malware scanners in VirusTotal against realistic adversarial malware.

> Compiled binary executables are often the only available artifact in reverse engineering, malware analysis, and software systems maintenance. Unfortunately, the lack of semantic information like variable types makes comprehending binaries difficult. In efforts to improve the comprehensibility of binaries, researchers have recently used machine learning techniques to predict semantic information contained in the original source code. Chen et al. implemented DIRTY, a Transformer-based Encoder-Decoder architecture capable of augmenting decompiled code with variable names and types by leveraging decompiler output tokens and variable size information. Chen et al. were able to demonstrate a substantial increase in name and type extraction accuracy on Hex-Rays decompiler outputs compared to existing static analysis and AI-based techniques. We extend the original DIRTY results by re-training the DIRTY model on a dataset produced by the open-source Ghidra decompiler. Although Chen et al. concluded that Ghidra was not a suitable decompiler candidate due to its difficulty in parsing and incorporating DWARF symbols during analysis, we demonstrate that straightforward parsing of variable data generated by Ghidra results in similar retyping performance. We hope this work inspires further interest and adoption of the Ghidra decompiler for use in research projects.

> Network analysis and machine learning techniques have been widely applied for building malware detection systems. Though these systems attain impressive results, they often are $(i)$ not extensible, being monolithic, well tuned for the specific task they have been designed for but very difficult to adapt and/or extend to other settings, and $(ii)$ not interpretable, being black boxes whose inner complexity makes it impossible to link the result of detection with its root cause, making further analysis of threats a challenge. In this paper we present RADAR, an extensible and explainable system that exploits the popular TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) ontology of adversary behaviour described in the industry-standard MITRE ATT\&CK framework in order to unequivocally identify and classify malicious behaviour using network traffic. We evaluate RADAR on a very large dataset comprising of 2,286,907 malicious and benign samples, representing a total of 84,792,452 network flows. The experimental analysis confirms that the proposed methodology can be effectively exploited: RADAR's ability to detect malware is comparable to other state-of-the-art non-interpretable systems' capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, RADAR is the first TTP-based system for malware detection that uses machine learning while being extensible and explainable.

> Antivirus developers are increasingly embracing machine learning as a key component of malware defense. While machine learning achieves cutting-edge outcomes in many fields, it also has weaknesses that are exploited by several adversarial attack techniques. Many authors have presented both white-box and black-box generators of adversarial malware examples capable of bypassing malware detectors with varying success. We propose to combine contemporary generators in order to increase their potential. Combining different generators can create more sophisticated adversarial examples that are more likely to evade anti-malware tools. We demonstrated this technique on five well-known generators and recorded promising results. The best-performing combination of AMG-random and MAB-Malware generators achieved an average evasion rate of 15.9% against top-tier antivirus products. This represents an average improvement of more than 36% and 627% over using only the AMG-random and MAB-Malware generators, respectively. The generator that benefited the most from having another generator follow its procedure was the FGSM injection attack, which improved the evasion rate on average between 91.97% and 1,304.73%, depending on the second generator used. These results demonstrate that combining different generators can significantly improve their effectiveness against leading antivirus programs.

Observe what their users do online, in their emails, and on their so-called personal laptops while at work. Our team will develop a key-logger for this Journal project that will allow us to capture every keystroke. Additionally, it will enable us to capture the mouse movements and clicks. This will enable us to keep an eye on how a person uses the internet and every other application on his or her "own" computer. Keyloggers, on the other hand, can also be used to steal data in the form of malware or something comparable. An anti-key logger will also be created to address this issue, allowing us to determine whether a key logger is already monitoring the system. We will be able to remain watchful and maintain the security of the data on our system thanks to the anti-keylogger.

> Domain Name System (DNS) is the backbone of the Internet. However, threat actors have abused the antiquated protocol to facilitate command-and-control (C2) actions, to tunnel, or to exfiltrate sensitive information in novel ways. The FireEye breach and Solarwinds intrusions of late 2020 demonstrated the sophistication of hacker groups. Researchers were eager to reverse-engineer the malware and eager to decode the encrypted traffic. Noticeably, organizations were keen on being first to "solve the puzzle". Dr. Eric Cole of SANS Institute routinely expressed "prevention is ideal, but detection is a must". Detection analytics may not always provide the underlying context in encrypted traffic, but will at least give a fighting chance for defenders to detect the anomaly. SUNBURST is an open-source moniker for the backdoor that affected Solarwinds Orion. While analyzing the malware with security vendor research, there is a possible single-point-of-failure in the C2 phase of the Cyber Kill Chain provides an avenue for defenders to exploit and detect the activity itself. One small chance is better than none. The assumption is that encryption increases entropy in strings. SUNBURST relied on encryption to exfiltrate data through DNS queries of which the adversary prepended to registered Fully-Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs). These FQDNs were typo-squatted to mimic Amazon Web Services (AWS) domains. SUNBURST detection is possible through a simple 1-variable t-test across all DNS logs for a given day. The detection code is located on GitHub (https://github.com/MalwareMorghulis/SUNBURST).

> Malware authors often use cryptographic tools such as XOR encryption and block ciphers like AES to obfuscate part of the malware to evade detection. Use of cryptography may give the impression that these obfuscation techniques have some provable guarantees of success. In this paper, we take a closer look at the use of cryptographic tools to obfuscate malware. We first find that most techniques are easy to defeat (in principle), since the decryption algorithm and the key is shipped within the program. In order to clearly define an obfuscation technique's potential to evade detection we propose a principled definition of malware obfuscation, and then categorize instances of malware obfuscation that use cryptographic tools into those which evade detection and those which are detectable. We find that schemes that are hard to de-obfuscate necessarily rely on a construct based on environmental keying. We also show that cryptographic notions of obfuscation, e.g., indistinghuishability and virtual black box obfuscation, may not guarantee evasion detection under our model. However, they can be used in conjunction with environmental keying to produce hard to de-obfuscate versions of programs.

> Over the years, most research towards defenses against adversarial attacks on machine learning models has been in the image recognition domain. The ML-based malware detection domain has received less attention despite its importance. Moreover, most work exploring these defenses has focused on several methods but with no strategy when applying them. In this paper, we introduce StratDef, which is a strategic defense system based on a moving target defense approach. We overcome challenges related to the systematic construction, selection, and strategic use of models to maximize adversarial robustness. StratDef dynamically and strategically chooses the best models to increase the uncertainty for the attacker while minimizing critical aspects in the adversarial ML domain, like attack transferability. We provide the first comprehensive evaluation of defenses against adversarial attacks on machine learning for malware detection, where our threat model explores different levels of threat, attacker knowledge, capabilities, and attack intensities. We show that StratDef performs better than other defenses even when facing the peak adversarial threat. We also show that, of the existing defenses, only a few adversarially-trained models provide substantially better protection than just using vanilla models but are still outperformed by StratDef.

> This chapter introduces the concept of Autonomous Intelligent Cyber-defense Agents (AICAs), and briefly explains the importance of this field and the motivation for its emergence. AICA is a software agent that resides on a system, and is responsible for defending the system from cyber compromises and enabling the response and recovery of the system, usually autonomously. The autonomy of the agent is a necessity because of the growing scarcity of human cyber-experts who could defend systems, either remotely or onsite, and because sophisticated malware could degrade or spoof the communications of a system that uses a remote monitoring center. An AICA Reference Architecture has been proposed and defines five main functions: (1) sensing and world state identification, (2) planning and action selection, (3) collaboration and negotiation, (4) action execution and (5) learning and knowledge improvement. The chapter reviews the details of AICA's environment, functions and operations. As AICA is intended to make changes within its environment, there is a risk that an agent's action could harm a friendly computer. This risk must be balanced against the losses that could occur if the agent does not act. The chapter discusses means by which this risk can be managed and how AICA's design features could help build trust among its users.

> Increasing activity and the number of devices online are leading to increasing and more diverse cyber attacks. This continuously evolving attack activity makes signature-based detection methods ineffective. Once malware has infiltrated into a LAN, bypassing an external gateway or entering via an unsecured mobile device, it can potentially infect all nodes in the LAN as well as carry out nefarious activities such as stealing valuable data, leading to financial damage and loss of reputation. Such infiltration could be viewed as an insider attack, increasing the need for LAN monitoring and security. In this paper we aim to detect such inner-LAN activity by studying the variations in Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) calls within the LAN. We find anomalous nodes by modelling inner-LAN traffic using hierarchical forecasting methods. We substantially reduce the false positives ever present in anomaly detection, by using an extreme value theory based method. We use a dataset from a real inner-LAN monitoring project, containing over 10M ARP calls from 362 nodes. Furthermore, the small number of false positives generated using our methods, is a potential solution to the "alert fatigue" commonly reported by security experts.

> WebAssembly has become a crucial part of the modern web, offering a faster alternative to JavaScript in browsers. While boosting rich applications in browser, this technology is also very efficient to develop cryptojacking malware. This has triggered the development of several methods to detect cryptojacking malware. However, these defenses have not considered the possibility of attackers using evasion techniques. This paper explores how automatic binary diversification can support the evasion of WebAssembly cryptojacking detectors. We experiment with a dataset of 33 WebAssembly cryptojacking binaries and evaluate our evasion technique against two malware detectors: VirusTotal, a general-purpose detector, and MINOS, a WebAssembly-specific detector. Our results demonstrate that our technique can automatically generate variants of WebAssembly cryptojacking that evade the detectors in 90% of cases for VirusTotal and 100% for MINOS. Our results emphasize the importance of meta-antiviruses and diverse detection techniques, and provide new insights into which WebAssembly code transformations are best suited for malware evasion. We also show that the variants introduce limited performance overhead, making binary diversification an effective technique for evasion.

> Approximate matching (AM) is a concept in digital forensics to determine the similarity between digital artifacts. An important use case of AM is the reliable and efficient detection of case-relevant data structures on a blacklist, if only fragments of the original are available. For instance, if only a cluster of indexed malware is still present during the digital forensic investigation, the AM algorithm shall be able to assign the fragment to the blacklisted malware. However, traditional AM functions like TLSH and ssdeep fail to detect files based on their fragments if the presented piece is relatively small compared to the overall file size. A second well-known issue with traditional AM algorithms is the lack of scaling due to the ever-increasing lookup databases. We propose an improved matching algorithm based on transformer models from the field of natural language processing. We call our approach Deep Learning Approximate Matching (DLAM). As a concept from artificial intelligence (AI), DLAM gets knowledge of characteristic blacklisted patterns during its training phase. Then DLAM is able to detect the patterns in a typically much larger file, that is DLAM focuses on the use case of fragment detection. We reveal that DLAM has three key advantages compared to the prominent conventional approaches TLSH and ssdeep. First, it makes the tedious extraction of known to be bad parts obsolete, which is necessary until now before any search for them with AM algorithms. This allows efficient classification of files on a much larger scale, which is important due to exponentially increasing data to be investigated. Second, depending on the use case, DLAM achieves a similar or even significantly higher accuracy in recovering fragments of blacklisted files. Third, we show that DLAM enables the detection of file correlations in the output of TLSH and ssdeep even for small fragment sizes.

> RISC-V is an emerging technology, with applications ranging from embedded devices to high-performance servers. Therefore, more and more security-critical workloads will be conducted with code that is compiled for RISC-V. Well-known microarchitectural side-channel attacks against established platforms like x86 apply to RISC-V CPUs as well. As RISC-V does not mandate any hardware-based side-channel countermeasures, a piece of code compiled for a generic RISC-V CPU in a cloud server cannot make safe assumptions about the microarchitecture on which it is running. Existing tools for aiding software-level precautions by checking side-channel vulnerabilities on source code or x86 binaries are not compatible with RISC-V machine code.   In this work, we study the requirements and goals of architecture-specific leakage analysis for RISC-V and illustrate how to achieve these goals with the help of fast and precise dynamic binary analysis. We implement all necessary building blocks for finding side-channel leakages on RISC-V, while relying on existing mature solutions when possible. Our leakage analysis builds upon the modular side-channel analysis framework Microwalk, that examines execution traces for leakage through secret-dependent memory accesses or branches. To provide suitable traces, we port the ARM dynamic binary instrumentation tool MAMBO to RISC-V. Our port named MAMBO-V can instrument arbitrary binaries which use the 64-bit general purpose instruction set. We evaluate our toolchain on several cryptographic libraries with RISC-V support and identify multiple exploitable leakages.

> A large amount of new malware is constantly being generated, which must not only be distinguished from benign samples, but also classified into malware families. For this purpose, investigating how existing malware families are developed and examining emerging families need to be explored. This paper focuses on the online processing of incoming malicious samples to assign them to existing families or, in the case of samples from new families, to cluster them. We experimented with seven prevalent malware families from the EMBER dataset, with four in the training set and three additional new families in the test set. Based on the classification score of the multilayer perceptron, we determined which samples would be classified and which would be clustered into new malware families. We classified 97.21% of streaming data with a balanced accuracy of 95.33%. Then, we clustered the remaining data using a self-organizing map, achieving a purity from 47.61% for four clusters to 77.68% for ten clusters. These results indicate that our approach has the potential to be applied to the classification and clustering of zero-day malware into malware families.

> We study the challenging task of malware recognition on both known and novel unknown malware families, called malware open-set recognition (MOSR). Previous works usually assume the malware families are known to the classifier in a close-set scenario, i.e., testing families are the subset or at most identical to training families. However, novel unknown malware families frequently emerge in real-world applications, and as such, require to recognize malware instances in an open-set scenario, i.e., some unknown families are also included in the test-set, which has been rarely and non-thoroughly investigated in the cyber-security domain. One practical solution for MOSR may consider jointly classifying known and detecting unknown malware families by a single classifier (e.g., neural network) from the variance of the predicted probability distribution on known families. However, conventional well-trained classifiers usually tend to obtain overly high recognition probabilities in the outputs, especially when the instance feature distributions are similar to each other, e.g., unknown v.s. known malware families, and thus dramatically degrades the recognition on novel unknown malware families. In this paper, we propose a novel model that can conservatively synthesize malware instances to mimic unknown malware families and support a more robust training of the classifier. Moreover, we also build a new large-scale malware dataset, named MAL-100, to fill the gap of lacking large open-set malware benchmark dataset. Experimental results on two widely used malware datasets and our MAL-100 demonstrate the effectiveness of our model compared with other representative methods.

> Malware open-set recognition (MOSR) aims at jointly classifying malware samples from known families and detect the ones from novel unknown families, respectively. Existing works mostly rely on a well-trained classifier considering the predicted probabilities of each known family with a threshold-based detection to achieve the MOSR. However, our observation reveals that the feature distributions of malware samples are extremely similar to each other even between known and unknown families. Thus the obtained classifier may produce overly high probabilities of testing unknown samples toward known families and degrade the model performance. In this paper, we propose the Multi-modal Dual-Embedding Networks, dubbed MDENet, to take advantage of comprehensive malware features (i.e., malware images and malware sentences) from different modalities to enhance the diversity of malware feature space, which is more representative and discriminative for down-stream recognition. Last, to further guarantee the open-set recognition, we dually embed the fused multi-modal representation into one primary space and an associated sub-space, i.e., discriminative and exclusive spaces, with contrastive sampling and rho-bounded enclosing sphere regularizations, which resort to classification and detection, respectively. Moreover, we also enrich our previously proposed large-scaled malware dataset MAL-100 with multi-modal characteristics and contribute an improved version dubbed MAL-100+. Experimental results on the widely used malware dataset Mailing and the proposed MAL-100+ demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

In this paper, we provide a brief overview of malware detection and classification methodologies. Moreover, we introduce a novel framework tailored for the dynamic analysis environment, called the Incremental Malware Detection and Classification Framework (IMDCF). IMDCF offers a comprehensive solution for general-purpose malware detection and classification, achieving an accuracy rate of 96.49% while maintaining a simple architecture.

> With the increasing number and sophistication of malware attacks, malware detection systems based on machine learning (ML) grow in importance. At the same time, many popular ML models used in malware classification are supervised solutions. These supervised classifiers often do not generalize well to novel malware. Therefore, they need to be re-trained frequently to detect new malware specimens, which can be time-consuming. Our work addresses this problem in a hybrid framework of theoretical Quantum ML, combined with feature selection strategies to reduce the data size and malware classifier training time. The preliminary results show that VQC with XGBoost selected features can get a 78.91% test accuracy on the simulator. The average accuracy for the model trained using the features selected with XGBoost was 74% (+- 11.35%) on the IBM 5 qubits machines.

> WebAssembly (Wasm) is a low-level binary format for web applications, which has found widespread adoption due to its improved performance and compatibility with existing software. However, the popularity of Wasm has also led to its exploitation for malicious purposes, such as cryptojacking, where malicious actors use a victim's computing resources to mine cryptocurrencies without their consent. To counteract this threat, machine learning-based detection methods aiming to identify cryptojacking activities within Wasm code have emerged. It is well-known that neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks, where inputs to a classifier are perturbed with minimal changes that result in a crass misclassification. While applying changes in image classification is easy, manipulating binaries in an automated fashion to evade malware classification without changing functionality is non-trivial. In this work, we propose a new approach to include adversarial examples in the code section of binaries via instrumentation. The introduced gadgets allow for the inclusion of arbitrary bytes, enabling efficient adversarial attacks that reliably bypass state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers such as the CNN-based Minos recently proposed at NDSS 2021. We analyze the cost and reliability of instrumentation-based adversarial example generation and show that the approach works reliably at minimal size and performance overheads.

> Being on a mushrooming spree since at least 2013, malware can take a large toll on any system. In a perpetual cat-and-mouse chase with defenders, malware writers constantly conjure new methods to hide their code so as to evade detection by security products. In this context, focusing on the MS Windows platform, this work contributes a comprehensive empirical evaluation regarding the detection capacity of popular, off-the-shelf antivirus and endpoint detection and response engines when facing legacy malware obfuscated via more or less uncommon but publicly known methods. Our experiments exploit a blend of seven traditional AV evasion techniques in 16 executables built in C++, Go, and Rust. Furthermore, we conduct an incipient study regarding the ability of the ChatGPT chatbot in assisting threat actors to produce ready-to-use malware. The derived results in terms of detection rate are highly unexpected: approximately half of the 12 tested AV engines were able to detect less than half of the malware variants, four AVs exactly half of the variants, while only two of the rest detected all but one of the variants.

> As IoT devices are becoming widely deployed, there exist many threats to IoT-based systems due to their inherent vulnerabilities. One effective approach to improving IoT security is to deploy IoT honeypot systems, which can collect attack information and reveal the methods and strategies used by attackers. However, building high-interaction IoT honeypots is challenging due to the heterogeneity of IoT devices. Vulnerabilities in IoT devices typically depend on specific device types or firmware versions, which encourages attackers to perform pre-attack checks to gather device information before launching attacks. Moreover, conventional honeypots are easily detected because their replying logic differs from that of the IoT devices they try to mimic. To address these problems, we develop an adaptive high-interaction honeypot for IoT devices, called HoneyIoT. We first build a real device based attack trace collection system to learn how attackers interact with IoT devices. We then model the attack behavior through markov decision process and leverage reinforcement learning techniques to learn the best responses to engage attackers based on the attack trace. We also use differential analysis techniques to mutate response values in some fields to generate high-fidelity responses. HoneyIoT has been deployed on the public Internet. Experimental results show that HoneyIoT can effectively bypass the pre-attack checks and mislead the attackers into uploading malware. Furthermore, HoneyIoT is covert against widely used reconnaissance and honeypot detection tools.

> Cybersecurity attacks against industrial control systems and cyber-physical systems can cause catastrophic real-world damage by infecting device binaries with malware. Mitigating such attacks can benefit from reverse engineering tools that recover sufficient semantic knowledge in terms of mathematical operations in the code. Conventional reverse engineering tools can decompile binaries to low-level code, but offer little semantic insight. This paper proposes REMaQE, an automated framework for reverse engineering of math equations from binary executables. REMaQE uses symbolic execution for dynamic analysis of the binary to extract the relevant semantic knowledge of the implemented algorithms. REMaQE provides an automatic parameter analysis pass which also leverages symbolic execution to identify input, output, and constant parameters of the implemented math equations. REMaQE automatically handles parameters accessed via registers, the stack, global memory, or pointers, and supports reverse engineering of object-oriented implementations such as C++ classes. REMaQE uses an algebraic simplification method which allows it to scale to complex conditional equations with ease. These features make REMaQE stand out over existing reverse engineering approaches for math equations. On a dataset of randomly generated math equations compiled to binaries from C and Simulink implementations, REMaQE accurately recovers a semantically matching equation for 97.53% of the models. For complex equations with more operations, accuracy stays consistently over 94%. REMaQE executes in 0.25 seconds on average and in 1.3 seconds for more complex equations. This real-time execution speed enables a smooth integration in an interactive mathematics-oriented reverse engineering workflow.

One such technique is applying Mixed-Boolean Arithmetic (MBA) expressions as a way to create opaque predicates and diversify and obfuscate the data flow.   In this work we aim to provide tools for the simplification of nonlinear MBA expressions in a very practical context to compete in the arms race between the generation of hard, diverse MBAs and their analysis. The proposed algorithm GAMBA employs algebraic rewriting at its core and extends SiMBA. It achieves efficient deobfuscation of MBA expressions from the most widely tested public datasets and simplifies expressions to their ground truths in most cases, surpassing peer tools.

> Malware is a significant threat to the security of computer systems and networks which requires sophisticated techniques to analyze the behavior and functionality for detection. Traditional signature-based malware detection methods have become ineffective in detecting new and unknown malware due to their rapid evolution. One of the most promising techniques that can overcome the limitations of signature-based detection is to use control flow graphs (CFGs). CFGs leverage the structural information of a program to represent the possible paths of execution as a graph, where nodes represent instructions and edges represent control flow dependencies. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are being used to extract these features from CFGs and classify them as malicious or benign. In this survey, we aim to review some state-of-the-art methods for malware detection through CFGs using ML, focusing on the different ways of extracting, representing, and classifying. Specifically, we present a comprehensive overview of different types of CFG features that have been used as well as different ML algorithms that have been applied to CFG-based malware detection. We provide an in-depth analysis of the challenges and limitations of these approaches, as well as suggest potential solutions to address some open problems and promising future directions for research in this field.

> Outsourced computing is widely used today. However, current approaches for protecting client data in outsourced computing fall short: use of cryptographic techniques like fully-homomorphic encryption incurs substantial costs, whereas use of hardware-assisted trusted execution environments has been shown to be vulnerable to server malware, run-time attacks, and side-channel attacks.   We present Blinded Memory (BliMe), an architecture to realize efficient and secure outsourced computation. BliMe consists of a novel and minimal set of ISA extensions implementing a taint-tracking policy to ensure the confidentiality of client data even in the presence of server vulnerabilities. To secure outsourced computation, the BliMe extensions can be used together with an attestable, fixed-function hardware security module (HSM) and an encryption engine that provides atomic decrypt-and-taint and encrypt-and-untaint operations. Clients rely on remote attestation and key agreement with the HSM to ensure that their data can be transferred securely to and from the encryption engine and will always be protected by BliMe's taint-tracking policy while at the server.   We provide a machine-checked security proof of BliMe extensions, and an RTL implementation BliMe-BOOM based on the BOOM RISC-V core. BliMe-BOOM incurs no reduction in clock frequency relative to unmodified BOOM, nor does it use significantly more power (<0.5%) or FPGA resources (<5.5%). Various implementations of BliMe (on FPGA and the gem5 simulator) incur only moderate performance overhead (8-25%).

> While the literature on security attacks and defense of Machine Learning (ML) systems mostly focuses on unrealistic adversarial examples, recent research has raised concern about the under-explored field of realistic adversarial attacks and their implications on the robustness of real-world systems. Our paper paves the way for a better understanding of adversarial robustness against realistic attacks and makes two major contributions. First, we conduct a study on three real-world use cases (text classification, botnet detection, malware detection)) and five datasets in order to evaluate whether unrealistic adversarial examples can be used to protect models against realistic examples. Our results reveal discrepancies across the use cases, where unrealistic examples can either be as effective as the realistic ones or may offer only limited improvement. Second, to explain these results, we analyze the latent representation of the adversarial examples generated with realistic and unrealistic attacks. We shed light on the patterns that discriminate which unrealistic examples can be used for effective hardening. We release our code, datasets and models to support future research in exploring how to reduce the gap between unrealistic and realistic adversarial attacks.

> Malware detection models based on deep learning have been widely used, but recent research shows that deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks are to deceive the deep learning model by generating adversarial samples. When adversarial attacks are performed on the malware detection model, the attacker will generate adversarial malware with the same malicious functions as the malware, and make the detection model classify it as benign software. Studying adversarial malware generation can help model designers improve the robustness of malware detection models. At present, in the work on adversarial malware generation for byte-to-image malware detection models, there are mainly problems such as large amount of injection perturbation and low generation efficiency. Therefore, this paper proposes FGAM (Fast Generate Adversarial Malware), a method for fast generating adversarial malware, which iterates perturbed bytes according to the gradient sign to enhance adversarial capability of the perturbed bytes until the adversarial malware is successfully generated. It is experimentally verified that the success rate of the adversarial malware deception model generated by FGAM is increased by about 84\% compared with existing methods.

> Large language models for code have recently shown remarkable performance in generating executable code. However, this rapid advancement has been accompanied by many legal and ethical concerns, such as code licensing issues, code plagiarism, and malware generation, making watermarking machine-generated code a very timely problem. Despite such imminent needs, we discover that existing watermarking and machine-generated text detection methods for LLMs fail to function with code generation tasks properly. Hence, in this work, we propose a new watermarking method, SWEET, that significantly improves upon previous approaches when watermarking machine-generated code. Our proposed method selectively applies watermarking to the tokens with high enough entropy, surpassing a defined threshold. The experiments on code generation benchmarks show that our watermarked code has superior quality compared to code produced by the previous state-of-the-art LLM watermarking method. Furthermore, our watermark method also outperforms DetectGPT for the task of machine-generated code detection.

> The Internet of Things(IoT) paradigm provides persistent sensing and data collection capabilities and is becoming increasingly prevalent across many market sectors. However, most IoT devices emphasize usability and function over security, making them very vulnerable to malicious exploits. This concern is evidenced by the increased use of compromised IoT devices in large scale bot networks (botnets) to launch distributed denial of service(DDoS) attacks against high value targets. Unsecured IoT systems can also provide entry points to private networks, allowing adversaries relatively easy access to valuable resources and services. Indeed, these evolving IoT threat vectors (ranging from brute force attacks to remote code execution exploits) are posing key challenges. Moreover, many traditional security mechanisms are not amenable for deployment on smaller resource-constrained IoT platforms. As a result, researchers have been developing a range of methods for IoT security, with many strategies using advanced machine learning(ML) techniques. Along these lines, this paper presents a novel generative adversarial network(GAN) solution to detect threats from malicious IoT devices both inside and outside a network. This model is trained using both benign IoT traffic and global darknet data and further evaluated in a testbed with real IoT devices and malware threats.

> This research article critically examines the potential risks and implications arising from the malicious utilization of large language models(LLM), focusing specifically on ChatGPT and Google's Bard. Although these large language models have numerous beneficial applications, the misuse of this technology by cybercriminals for creating offensive payloads and tools is a significant concern. In this study, we systematically generated implementable code for the top-10 MITRE Techniques prevalent in 2022, utilizing ChatGPT, and conduct a comparative analysis of its performance with Google's Bard. Our experimentation reveals that ChatGPT has the potential to enable attackers to accelerate the operation of more targeted and sophisticated attacks. Additionally, the technology provides amateur attackers with more capabilities to perform a wide range of attacks and empowers script kiddies to develop customized tools that contribute to the acceleration of cybercrime. Furthermore, LLMs significantly benefits malware authors, particularly ransomware gangs, in generating sophisticated variants of wiper and ransomware attacks with ease. On a positive note, our study also highlights how offensive security researchers and pentesters can make use of LLMs to simulate realistic attack scenarios, identify potential vulnerabilities, and better protect organizations. Overall, we conclude by emphasizing the need for increased vigilance in mitigating the risks associated with LLMs. This includes implementing robust security measures, increasing awareness and education around the potential risks of this technology, and collaborating with security experts to stay ahead of emerging threats.

> In today's interconnected digital landscape, the proliferation of malware poses a significant threat to the security and stability of computer networks and systems worldwide. As the complexity of malicious tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) continuously grows to evade detection, so does the need for advanced methods capable of capturing and characterizing malware behavior. The current state of the art in malware classification and detection uses task specific objectives; however, this method fails to generalize to other downstream tasks involving the same malware class. In this paper, the authors introduce a novel method that combines convolutional neural networks, standard graph embedding techniques, and a metric learning objective to extract meaningful information from network flow data and create strong embeddings characterizing malware behavior. These embeddings enable the development of highly accurate, efficient, and generalizable machine learning models for tasks such as malware strain classification, zero day threat detection, and closest attack type attribution as demonstrated in this paper. A shift from task specific objectives to strong embeddings will not only allow rapid iteration of cyber-threat detection models, but also allow different modalities to be introduced in the development of these models.

> Chatbots shifted from rule-based to artificial intelligence techniques and gained traction in medicine, shopping, customer services, food delivery, education, and research. OpenAI developed ChatGPT blizzard on the Internet as it crossed one million users within five days of its launch. However, with the enhanced popularity, chatbots experienced cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. This paper discussed the relevant literature, reports, and explanatory incident attacks generated against chatbots. Our initial point is to explore the timeline of chatbots from ELIZA (an early natural language processing computer program) to GPT-4 and provide the working mechanism of ChatGPT. Subsequently, we explored the cybersecurity attacks and vulnerabilities in chatbots. Besides, we investigated the ChatGPT, specifically in the context of creating the malware code, phishing emails, undetectable zero-day attacks, and generation of macros and LOLBINs. Furthermore, the history of cyberattacks and vulnerabilities exploited by cybercriminals are discussed, particularly considering the risk and vulnerabilities in ChatGPT. Addressing these threats and vulnerabilities requires specific strategies and measures to reduce the harmful consequences. Therefore, the future directions to address the challenges were presented.

> Increased dependence of the maritime industry on information and communication networks has made shipboard power systems vulnerable to stealthy cyber-attacks. One such attack variant, called rootkit, can leverage system knowledge to hide its presence and allow remotely located malware handlers to gain complete control of infected subsystems. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the threat landscape imposed by such attack variants on Medium Voltage DC (MVDC) shipboard microgrids, including a discussion of their impact on the overall maritime sector in general, and provides several simulation results to demonstrate the same. It also analyzes and presents the actions of possible defense mechanisms, with specific emphasis on evasion, deception, and detection frameworks, that will help ship operators and maritime cybersecurity professionals protect their systems from such attacks.

> In recent years, self-attention has become the dominant paradigm for sequence modeling in a variety of domains. However, in domains with very long sequence lengths the $\mathcal{O}(T^2)$ memory and $\mathcal{O}(T^2 H)$ compute costs can make using transformers infeasible. Motivated by problems in malware detection, where sequence lengths of $T \geq 100,000$ are a roadblock to deep learning, we re-cast self-attention using the neuro-symbolic approach of Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR). In doing so we perform the same high-level strategy of the standard self-attention: a set of queries matching against a set of keys, and returning a weighted response of the values for each key. Implemented as a ``Hrrformer'' we obtain several benefits including $\mathcal{O}(T H \log H)$ time complexity, $\mathcal{O}(T H)$ space complexity, and convergence in $10\times$ fewer epochs. Nevertheless, the Hrrformer achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy on LRA benchmarks and we are able to learn with just a single layer. Combined, these benefits make our Hrrformer the first viable Transformer for such long malware classification sequences and up to $280\times$ faster to train on the Long Range Arena benchmark.

> The burgeoning fields of machine learning (ML) and quantum machine learning (QML) have shown remarkable potential in tackling complex problems across various domains. However, their susceptibility to adversarial attacks raises concerns when deploying these systems in security sensitive applications. In this study, we present a comparative analysis of the vulnerability of ML and QML models, specifically conventional neural networks (NN) and quantum neural networks (QNN), to adversarial attacks using a malware dataset. We utilize a software supply chain attack dataset known as ClaMP and develop two distinct models for QNN and NN, employing Pennylane for quantum implementations and TensorFlow and Keras for traditional implementations. Our methodology involves crafting adversarial samples by introducing random noise to a small portion of the dataset and evaluating the impact on the models performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics. Based on our observations, both ML and QML models exhibit vulnerability to adversarial attacks. While the QNNs accuracy decreases more significantly compared to the NN after the attack, it demonstrates better performance in terms of precision and recall, indicating higher resilience in detecting true positives under adversarial conditions. We also find that adversarial samples crafted for one model type can impair the performance of the other, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms. Our study serves as a foundation for future research focused on enhancing the security and resilience of ML and QML models, particularly QNN, given its recent advancements. A more extensive range of experiments will be conducted to better understand the performance and robustness of both models in the face of adversarial attacks.

> Quantum machine learning (QML) is an emerging field of research that leverages quantum computing to improve the classical machine learning approach to solve complex real world problems. QML has the potential to address cybersecurity related challenges. Considering the novelty and complex architecture of QML, resources are not yet explicitly available that can pave cybersecurity learners to instill efficient knowledge of this emerging technology. In this research, we design and develop QML-based ten learning modules covering various cybersecurity topics by adopting student centering case-study based learning approach. We apply one subtopic of QML on a cybersecurity topic comprised of pre-lab, lab, and post-lab activities towards providing learners with hands-on QML experiences in solving real-world security problems. In order to engage and motivate students in a learning environment that encourages all students to learn, pre-lab offers a brief introduction to both the QML subtopic and cybersecurity problem. In this paper, we utilize quantum support vector machine (QSVM) for malware classification and protection where we use open source Pennylane QML framework on the drebin215 dataset. We demonstrate our QSVM model and achieve an accuracy of 95% in malware classification and protection. We will develop all the modules and introduce them to the cybersecurity community in the coming days.

> To date, a large number of research papers have been written on the classification of malware, its identification, classification into different families and the distinction between malware and goodware. These works have been based on captured malware samples and have attempted to analyse malware and goodware using various techniques, including techniques from the field of artificial intelligence. For example, neural networks have played a significant role in these classification methods. Some of this work also deals with analysing malware using its visualisation. These works usually convert malware samples capturing the structure of malware into image structures, which are then the object of image processing. In this paper, we propose a very unconventional and novel approach to malware visualisation based on dynamic behaviour analysis, with the idea that the images, which are visually very interesting, are then used to classify malware concerning goodware. Our approach opens an extensive topic for future discussion and provides many new directions for research in malware analysis and classification, as discussed in conclusion. The results of the presented experiments are based on a database of 6 589 997 goodware, 827 853 potentially unwanted applications and 4 174 203 malware samples provided by ESET and selected experimental data (images, generating polynomial formulas and software generating images) are available on GitHub for interested readers. Thus, this paper is not a comprehensive compact study that reports the results obtained from comparative experiments but rather attempts to show a new direction in the field of visualisation with possible applications in malware analysis.

> Covert communication has become an important area of research in computer security. It involves hiding specific information on a carrier for message transmission and is often used to transmit private data, military secrets, and even malware. In deep learning, many methods have been developed for hiding information in models to achieve covert communication. However, these methods are not applicable to federated learning, where model aggregation invalidates the exact information embedded in the model by the client. To address this problem, we propose a novel method for covert communication in federated learning based on the poisoning attack. Our approach achieves 100% accuracy in covert message transmission between two clients and is shown to be both stealthy and robust through extensive experiments. However, existing defense methods are limited in their effectiveness against our attack scheme, highlighting the urgent need for new protection methods to be developed. Our study emphasizes the necessity of research in covert communication and serves as a foundation for future research in federated learning attacks and defenses.

> Model stealing attacks have been successfully used in many machine learning domains, but there is little understanding of how these attacks work against models that perform malware detection. Malware detection and, in general, security domains have unique conditions. In particular, there are very strong requirements for low false positive rates (FPR). Antivirus products (AVs) that use machine learning are very complex systems to steal, malware binaries continually change, and the whole environment is adversarial by nature. This study evaluates active learning model stealing attacks against publicly available stand-alone machine learning malware classifiers and also against antivirus products. The study proposes a new neural network architecture for surrogate models (dualFFNN) and a new model stealing attack that combines transfer and active learning for surrogate creation (FFNN-TL). We achieved good surrogates of the stand-alone classifiers with up to 99\% agreement with the target models, using less than 4% of the original training dataset. Good surrogates of AV systems were also trained with up to 99% agreement and less than 4,000 queries. The study uses the best surrogates to generate adversarial malware to evade the target models, both stand-alone and AVs (with and without an internet connection). Results show that surrogate models can generate adversarial malware that evades the targets but with a lower success rate than directly using the target models to generate adversarial malware. Using surrogates, however, is still a good option since using the AVs for malware generation is highly time-consuming and easily detected when the AVs are connected to the internet.

> Decompilation aims to recover the source code form of a binary executable. It has many applications in security and software engineering such as malware analysis, vulnerability detection and code reuse. A prominent challenge in decompilation is to recover variable names. We propose a novel method that leverages the synergy of large language model (LLM) and program analysis. Language models encode rich multi-modal knowledge, but its limited input size prevents providing sufficient global context for name recovery. We propose to divide the task to many LLM queries and use program analysis to correlate and propagate the query results, which in turn improves the performance of LLM by providing additional contextual information. Our results show that 75% of the recovered names are considered good by users and our technique outperforms the state-of-the-art technique by 16.5% and 20.23% in precision and recall, respectively.

> Decision-based evasion attacks repeatedly query a black-box classifier to generate adversarial examples. Prior work measures the cost of such attacks by the total number of queries made to the classifier. We argue this metric is flawed. Most security-critical machine learning systems aim to weed out "bad" data (e.g., malware, harmful content, etc). Queries to such systems carry a fundamentally asymmetric cost: queries detected as "bad" come at a higher cost because they trigger additional security filters, e.g., usage throttling or account suspension. Yet, we find that existing decision-based attacks issue a large number of "bad" queries, which likely renders them ineffective against security-critical systems. We then design new attacks that reduce the number of bad queries by $1.5$-$7.3\times$, but often at a significant increase in total (non-bad) queries. We thus pose it as an open problem to build black-box attacks that are more effective under realistic cost metrics.

> The black-box nature of complex Neural Network (NN)-based models has hindered their widespread adoption in security domains due to the lack of logical explanations and actionable follow-ups for their predictions. To enhance the transparency and accountability of Graph Neural Network (GNN) security models used in system provenance analysis, we propose PROVEXPLAINER, a framework for projecting abstract GNN decision boundaries onto interpretable feature spaces.   We first replicate the decision-making process of GNNbased security models using simpler and explainable models such as Decision Trees (DTs). To maximize the accuracy and fidelity of the surrogate models, we propose novel graph structural features founded on classical graph theory and enhanced by extensive data study with security domain knowledge. Our graph structural features are closely tied to problem-space actions in the system provenance domain, which allows the detection results to be explained in descriptive, human language. PROVEXPLAINER allowed simple DT models to achieve 95% fidelity to the GNN on program classification tasks with general graph structural features, and 99% fidelity on malware detection tasks with a task-specific feature package tailored for direct interpretation. The explanations for malware classification are demonstrated with case studies of five real-world malware samples across three malware families.

We implement two models of Quantum Machine Learning algorithms, and we compare them to classical models for the classification of a dataset composed of malicious and benign executable files. We try to optimize our algorithms based on methods found in the literature, and analyze our results in an exploratory way, to identify the most interesting directions to explore for the future.

> Exploit proof-of-concepts (PoCs) for known vulnerabilities are widely shared in the security community. They help security analysts to learn from each other and they facilitate security assessments and red teaming tasks. In the recent years, PoCs have been widely distributed, e.g., via dedicated websites and platforms, and public code repositories such as GitHub. However, there is no guarantee that PoCs in public code repositories come from trustworthy sources or even that they do what they are supposed to do.   In this work we investigate GitHub-hosted PoCs for known vulnerabilities discovered in 2017--2021. We discovered that not all PoCs are trustworthy. Some proof-of-concepts are malicious, e.g., they attempt to exfiltrate data from the system they are being run on, or they try to install malware on this system, and in some cases they have hard-coded reverse shell listener.   To measure the prevalence of this threat, we propose an approach to detecting malicious PoCs. Our approach relies on the maliciousness symptoms we have observed in our PoC dataset: calls to malicious IP addresses, encoded malicious code, and included Trojanized binaries. With this approach, we have discovered 899 malicious repositories out of 47,285 repositories that have been downloaded and checked (i.e., 1.9% of the studied repositories have indicators of malicious intent). This figure shows a worrying prevalence of dangerous malicious PoCs among the exploit code distributed on GitHub.

> In recent years, the increase in non-Windows malware threats had turned the focus of the cybersecurity community. Research works on hunting Windows PE-based malwares are maturing, whereas the developments on Linux malware threat hunting are relatively scarce. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) era, smart devices that are getting integrated into human life have become a hackers highway for their malicious activities. The IoT devices employ various Unix-based architectures that follow ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) as their standard binary file specification. This study aims at providing a comprehensive survey on the latest developments in cross-architectural IoT malware detection and classification approaches. Aided by a modern taxonomy, we discuss the feature representations, feature extraction techniques, and machine learning models employed in the surveyed works. We further provide more insights on the practical challenges involved in cross-architectural IoT malware threat hunting and discuss various avenues to instill potential future research.

> When investigating a malicious file, searching for related files is a common task that malware analysts must perform. Given that production malware corpora may contain over a billion files and consume petabytes of storage, many feature extraction and similarity search approaches are computationally infeasible. Our work explores the potential of antivirus (AV) scan data as a scalable source of features for malware. This is possible because AV scan reports are widely available through services such as VirusTotal and are ~100x smaller than the average malware sample. The information within an AV scan report is abundant with information and can indicate a malicious file's family, behavior, target operating system, and many other characteristics. We introduce AVScan2Vec, a language model trained to comprehend the semantics of AV scan data. AVScan2Vec ingests AV scan data for a malicious file and outputs a meaningful vector representation. AVScan2Vec vectors are ~3 to 85x smaller than popular alternatives in use today, enabling faster vector comparisons and lower memory usage. By incorporating Dynamic Continuous Indexing, we show that nearest-neighbor queries on AVScan2Vec vectors can scale to even the largest malware production datasets. We also demonstrate that AVScan2Vec vectors are superior to other leading malware feature vector representations across nearly all classification, clustering, and nearest-neighbor lookup algorithms that we evaluated.

> In this paper, we propose a framework for early-stage malware detection and mitigation by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. Our primary contribution is presenting an approach for predicting the upcoming actions of malware by treating application programming interface (API) call sequences as natural language inputs and employing text classification methods, specifically a Bi-LSTM neural network, to predict the next API call. This enables proactive threat identification and mitigation, demonstrating the effectiveness of applying NLP principles to API call sequences. The Bi-LSTM model is evaluated using two datasets. %The model achieved an accuracy of 93.6\% and 88.8\% for the %first and second dataset respectively. Additionally, by modeling consecutive API calls as 2-gram and 3-gram strings, we extract new features to be further processed using a Bagging-XGBoost algorithm, effectively predicting malware presence at its early stages. The accuracy of the proposed framework is evaluated by simulations.

> Self-propagating malware (SPM) has recently resulted in large financial losses and high social impact, with well-known campaigns such as WannaCry and Colonial Pipeline being able to propagate rapidly on the Internet and cause service disruptions. To date, the propagation behavior of SPM is still not well understood, resulting in the difficulty of defending against these cyber threats. To address this gap, in this paper we perform a comprehensive analysis of a newly proposed epidemiological model for SPM propagation, Susceptible-Infected-Infected Dormant-Recovered (SIIDR). We perform a theoretical analysis of the stability of the SIIDR model and derive its basic reproduction number by representing it as a system of Ordinary Differential Equations with continuous time. We obtain access to 15 WananCry attack traces generated under various conditions, derive the model's transition rates, and show that SIIDR fits best the real data. We find that the SIIDR model outperforms more established compartmental models from epidemiology, such as SI, SIS, and SIR, at modeling SPM propagation.

> The vulnerability to adversarial examples remains one major obstacle for Machine Learning (ML)-based Android malware detection. Realistic attacks in the Android malware domain create Realizable Adversarial Examples (RealAEs), i.e., AEs that satisfy the domain constraints of Android malware. Recent studies have shown that using such RealAEs in Adversarial Training (AT) is more effective in defending against realistic attacks than using unrealizable AEs (unRealAEs). This is because RealAEs allow defenders to explore certain pockets in the feature space that are vulnerable to realistic attacks. However, existing defenses commonly generate RealAEs in the problem space, which is known to be time-consuming and impractical for AT. In this paper, we propose to generate RealAEs in the feature space, leading to a simpler and more efficient solution. Our approach is driven by a novel interpretation of Android domain constraints in the feature space. More concretely, our defense first learns feature-space domain constraints by extracting meaningful feature dependencies from data and then applies them to generating feature-space RealAEs during AT. Extensive experiments on DREBIN, a well-known Android malware detector, demonstrate that our new defense outperforms not only unRealAE-based AT but also the state-of-the-art defense that relies on non-uniform perturbations. We further validate the ability of our learned feature-space domain constraints in representing Android malware properties by showing that our feature-space domain constraints can help distinguish RealAEs from unRealAEs.

> Over the last decade, researchers have extensively explored the vulnerabilities of Android malware detectors to adversarial examples through the development of evasion attacks; however, the practicality of these attacks in real-world scenarios remains arguable. The majority of studies have assumed attackers know the details of the target classifiers used for malware detection, while in reality, malicious actors have limited access to the target classifiers. This paper introduces EvadeDroid, a practical decision-based adversarial attack designed to effectively evade black-box Android malware detectors in real-world scenarios. In addition to generating real-world adversarial malware, the proposed evasion attack can also preserve the functionality of the original malware applications (apps). EvadeDroid constructs a collection of functionality-preserving transformations derived from benign donors that share opcode-level similarity with malware apps by leveraging an n-gram-based approach. These transformations are then used to morph malware instances into benign ones via an iterative and incremental manipulation strategy. The proposed manipulation technique is a novel, query-efficient optimization algorithm that can find and inject optimal sequences of transformations into malware apps. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of EvadeDroid under soft- and hard-label attacks. Furthermore, EvadeDroid exhibits the capability to generate real-world adversarial examples that can effectively evade a wide range of black-box ML-based malware detectors with minimal query requirements. Finally, we show that the proposed problem-space adversarial attack is able to preserve its stealthiness against five popular commercial antiviruses, thus demonstrating its feasibility in the real world.

> As the smartphone market leader, Android has been a prominent target for malware attacks. The number of malicious applications (apps) identified for it has increased continually over the past decade, creating an immense challenge for all parties involved. For market holders and researchers, in particular, the large number of samples has made manual malware detection unfeasible, leading to an influx of research that investigate Machine Learning (ML) approaches to automate this process. However, while some of the proposed approaches achieve high performance, rapidly evolving Android malware has made them unable to maintain their accuracy over time. This has created a need in the community to conduct further research, and build more flexible ML pipelines. Doing so, however, is currently hindered by a lack of systematic overview of the existing literature, to learn from and improve upon the existing solutions. Existing survey papers often focus only on parts of the ML process (e.g., data collection or model deployment), while omitting other important stages, such as model evaluation and explanation. In this paper, we address this problem with a review of 42 highly-cited papers, spanning a decade of research (from 2011 to 2021). We introduce a novel procedural taxonomy of the published literature, covering how they have used ML algorithms, what features they have engineered, which dimensionality reduction techniques they have employed, what datasets they have employed for training, and what their evaluation and explanation strategies are. Drawing from this taxonomy, we also identify gaps in knowledge and provide ideas for improvement and future work.

> We consider the problem of program clone search, i.e. given a target program and a repository of known programs (all in executable format), the goal is to find the program in the repository most similar to our target program - with potential applications in terms of reverse engineering, program clustering, malware lineage and software theft detection. Recent years have witnessed a blooming in code similarity techniques, yet most of them focus on function-level similarity while we are interested in program-level similarity. Consequently, these recent approaches are not directly suited to program clone search, being either too slow to handle large code bases, not precise enough, or not robust against slight variations introduced by compilation or source code versions. We introduce Programs Spectral Similarity (PSS), the first spectral analysis dedicated to program-level similarity. PSS reaches a sweet spot in terms of precision, speed and robustness. Especially, its one-time spectral feature extraction is tailored for large repositories of programs, making it a perfect fit for program clone search.

- `2210.17376v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17376v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.17376v2)

> Interpretability, trustworthiness, and usability are key considerations in high-stake security applications, especially when utilizing deep learning models. While these models are known for their high accuracy, they behave as black boxes in which identifying important features and factors that led to a classification or a prediction is difficult. This can lead to uncertainty and distrust, especially when an incorrect prediction results in severe consequences. Thus, explanation methods aim to provide insights into the inner working of deep learning models. However, most explanation methods provide inconsistent explanations, have low fidelity, and are susceptible to adversarial manipulation, which can reduce model trustworthiness. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of explainable methods and demonstrates their efficacy in three distinct security applications: anomaly detection using system logs, malware prediction, and detection of adversarial images. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis reveals serious limitations and concerns in state-of-the-art explanation methods in all three applications. We show that explanation methods for security applications necessitate distinct characteristics, such as stability, fidelity, robustness, and usability, among others, which we outline as the prerequisites for trustworthy explanation methods.

> The criminal underground is populated with forum marketplaces where, allegedly, cybercriminals share and trade knowledge, skills, and cybercrime products. However, it is still unclear whether all marketplaces matter the same in the overall threat landscape. To effectively support trade and avoid degenerating into scams-for-scammers places, underground markets must address fundamental economic problems (such as moral hazard, adverse selection) that enable the exchange of actual technology and cybercrime products (as opposed to repackaged malware or years-old password databases). From the relevant literature and manual investigation, we identify several mechanisms that marketplaces implement to mitigate these problems, and we condense them into a market evaluation framework based on the Business Model Canvas. We use this framework to evaluate which mechanisms `successful' marketplaces have in place, and whether these differ from those employed by `unsuccessful' marketplaces. We test the framework on 23 underground forum markets by searching 836 aliases of indicted cybercriminals to identify `successful' marketplaces. We find evidence that marketplaces whose administrators are impartial in trade, verify their sellers, and have the right economic incentives to keep the market functional are more likely to be credible sources of threat.

> Machine learning methods can detect Android malware with very high accuracy. However, these classifiers have an Achilles heel, concept drift: they rapidly become out of date and ineffective, due to the evolution of malware apps and benign apps. Our research finds that, after training an Android malware classifier on one year's worth of data, the F1 score quickly dropped from 0.99 to 0.76 after 6 months of deployment on new test samples.   In this paper, we propose new methods to combat the concept drift problem of Android malware classifiers. Since machine learning technique needs to be continuously deployed, we use active learning: we select new samples for analysts to label, and then add the labeled samples to the training set to retrain the classifier. Our key idea is, similarity-based uncertainty is more robust against concept drift. Therefore, we combine contrastive learning with active learning. We propose a new hierarchical contrastive learning scheme, and a new sample selection technique to continuously train the Android malware classifier. Our evaluation shows that this leads to significant improvements, compared to previously published methods for active learning. Our approach reduces the false negative rate from 14% (for the best baseline) to 9%, while also reducing the false positive rate (from 0.86% to 0.48%). Also, our approach maintains more consistent performance across a seven-year time period than past methods.

- `2302.10739v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10739v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.10739v2)

> ML models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial query attacks. In these attacks, queries are iteratively perturbed towards a particular class without any knowledge of the target model besides its output. The prevalence of remotely-hosted ML classification models and Machine-Learning-as-a-Service platforms means that query attacks pose a real threat to the security of these systems. To deal with this, stateful defenses have been proposed to detect query attacks and prevent the generation of adversarial examples by monitoring and analyzing the sequence of queries received by the system. Several stateful defenses have been proposed in recent years. However, these defenses rely solely on similarity or out-of-distribution detection methods that may be effective in other domains. In the malware detection domain, the methods to generate adversarial examples are inherently different, and therefore we find that such detection mechanisms are significantly less effective. Hence, in this paper, we present MalProtect, which is a stateful defense against query attacks in the malware detection domain. MalProtect uses several threat indicators to detect attacks. Our results show that it reduces the evasion rate of adversarial query attacks by 80+\% in Android and Windows malware, across a range of attacker scenarios. In the first evaluation of its kind, we show that MalProtect outperforms prior stateful defenses, especially under the peak adversarial threat.

- *Jinting Zhu, Julian Jang-Jaccard, Amardeep Singh, Paul A. Watters, Seyit Camtepe*

- `2110.13409v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13409v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.13409v3)

> Malware authors apply different techniques of control flow obfuscation, in order to create new malware variants to avoid detection. Existing Siamese neural network (SNN)-based malware detection methods fail to correctly classify different malware families when such obfuscated malware samples are present in the training dataset, resulting in high false-positive rates. To address this issue, we propose a novel task-aware few-shot-learning-based Siamese Neural Network that is resilient against the presence of malware variants affected by such control flow obfuscation techniques. Using the average entropy features of each malware family as inputs, in addition to the image features, our model generates the parameters for the feature layers, to more accurately adjust the feature embedding for different malware families, each of which has obfuscated malware variants. In addition, our proposed method can classify malware classes, even if there are only one or a few training samples available. Our model utilizes few-shot learning with the extracted features of a pre-trained network (e.g., VGG-16), to avoid the bias typically associated with a model trained with a limited number of training samples. Our proposed approach is highly effective in recognizing unique malware signatures, thus correctly classifying malware samples that belong to the same malware family, even in the presence of obfuscated malware variants. Our experimental results, validated by N-way on N-shot learning, show that our model is highly effective in classification accuracy, exceeding a rate \textgreater 91\%, compared to other similar methods.

<summary>2023-06-16 15:48:40 - Query-Free Evasion Attacks Against Machine Learning-Based Malware Detectors with Generative Adversarial Networks</summary>

- *Daniel Gibert, Jordi Planes, Quan Le, Giulio Zizzo*

- `2306.09925v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09925v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.09925v1)

> Malware detectors based on machine learning (ML) have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial malware examples. However, current methods to generate adversarial malware examples still have their limits. They either rely on detailed model information (gradient-based attacks), or on detailed outputs of the model - such as class probabilities (score-based attacks), neither of which are available in real-world scenarios. Alternatively, adversarial examples might be crafted using only the label assigned by the detector (label-based attack) to train a substitute network or an agent using reinforcement learning. Nonetheless, label-based attacks might require querying a black-box system from a small number to thousands of times, depending on the approach, which might not be feasible against malware detectors. This work presents a novel query-free approach to craft adversarial malware examples to evade ML-based malware detectors. To this end, we have devised a GAN-based framework to generate adversarial malware examples that look similar to benign executables in the feature space. To demonstrate the suitability of our approach we have applied the GAN-based attack to three common types of features usually employed by static ML-based malware detectors: (1) Byte histogram features, (2) API-based features, and (3) String-based features. Results show that our model-agnostic approach performs on par with MalGAN, while generating more realistic adversarial malware examples without requiring any query to the malware detectors. Furthermore, we have tested the generated adversarial examples against state-of-the-art multimodal and deep learning malware detectors, showing a decrease in detection performance, as well as a decrease in the average number of detections by the anti-malware engines in VirusTotal.

> Cyber attacks deceive machines into believing something that does not exist in the first place. However, there are some to which even humans fall prey. One such famous attack that attackers have used over the years to exploit the vulnerability of vision is known to be a Homoglyph attack. It employs a primary yet effective mechanism to create illegitimate domains that are hard to differentiate from legit ones. Moreover, as the difference is pretty indistinguishable for a user to notice, they cannot stop themselves from clicking on these homoglyph domain names. In many cases, that results in either information theft or malware attack on their systems. Existing approaches use simple, string-based comparison techniques applied in primary language-based tasks. Although they are impactful to some extent, they usually fail because they are not robust to different types of homoglyphs and are computationally not feasible because of their time requirement proportional to the string length. Similarly, neural network-based approaches are employed to determine real domain strings from fake ones. Nevertheless, the problem with both methods is that they require paired sequences of real and fake domain strings to work with, which is often not the case in the real world, as the attacker only sends the illegitimate or homoglyph domain to the vulnerable user. Therefore, existing approaches are not suitable for practical scenarios in the real world. In our work, we created GlyphNet, an image dataset that contains 4M domains, both real and homoglyphs. Additionally, we introduce a baseline method for a homoglyph attack detection system using an attention-based convolutional Neural Network. We show that our model can reach state-of-the-art accuracy in detecting homoglyph attacks with a 0.93 AUC on our dataset.

> Malware detection has long been a stage for an ongoing arms race between malware authors and anti-virus systems. Solutions that utilize machine learning (ML) gain traction as the scale of this arms race increases. This trend, however, makes performing attacks directly on ML an attractive prospect for adversaries. We study this arms race from both perspectives in the context of MalConv, a popular convolutional neural network-based malware classifier that operates on raw bytes of files. First, we show that MalConv is vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks: appending a byte-level patch to malware files bypasses detection 94.3% of the time. Moreover, we develop a universal adversarial patch (UAP) attack where a single patch can drop the detection rate in constant time of any malware file that contains it by 80%. These patches are effective even being relatively small with respect to the original file size -- between 2%-8%. As a countermeasure, we then perform window ablation that allows us to apply de-randomized smoothing, a modern certified defense to patch attacks in vision tasks, to raw files. The resulting `smoothed-MalConv' can detect over 80% of malware that contains the universal patch and provides certified robustness up to 66%, outlining a promising step towards robust malware detection. To our knowledge, we are the first to apply universal adversarial patch attack and certified defense using ablations on byte level in the malware field.

> Malware is a significant threat to the security of computer systems and networks which requires sophisticated techniques to analyze the behavior and functionality for detection. Traditional signature-based malware detection methods have become ineffective in detecting new and unknown malware due to their rapid evolution. One of the most promising techniques that can overcome the limitations of signature-based detection is to use control flow graphs (CFGs). CFGs leverage the structural information of a program to represent the possible paths of execution as a graph, where nodes represent instructions and edges represent control flow dependencies. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are being used to extract these features from CFGs and classify them as malicious or benign. In this survey, we aim to review some state-of-the-art methods for malware detection through CFGs using ML, focusing on the different ways of extracting, representing, and classifying. Specifically, we present a comprehensive overview of different types of CFG features that have been used as well as different ML algorithms that have been applied to CFG-based malware detection. We provide an in-depth analysis of the challenges and limitations of these approaches, as well as suggest potential solutions to address some open problems and promising future directions for research in this field.

> Network operators and system administrators are increasingly overwhelmed with incessant cyber-security threats ranging from malicious network reconnaissance to attacks such as distributed denial of service and data breaches. A large number of these attacks could be prevented if the network operators were better equipped with threat intelligence information that would allow them to block or throttle nefarious scanning activities. Network telescopes or "darknets" offer a unique window into observing Internet-wide scanners and other malicious entities, and they could offer early warning signals to operators that would be critical for infrastructure protection and/or attack mitigation. A network telescope consists of unused or "dark" IP spaces that serve no users, and solely passively observes any Internet traffic destined to the "telescope sensor" in an attempt to record ubiquitous network scanners, malware that forage for vulnerable devices, and other dubious activities. Hence, monitoring network telescopes for timely detection of coordinated and heavy scanning activities is an important, albeit challenging, task. The challenges mainly arise due to the non-stationarity and the dynamic nature of Internet traffic and, more importantly, the fact that one needs to monitor high-dimensional signals (e.g., all TCP/UDP ports) to search for "sparse" anomalies. We propose statistical methods to address both challenges in an efficient and "online" manner; our work is validated both with synthetic data as well as real-world data from a large network telescope.

> Following the increasing trends of malicious applications or cyber threats in general, program analysis has become a ubiquitous technique in extracting relevant features. The current state-of-the-art solutions seem to fall behind new techniques. For instance, dynamic binary instrumentation (DBI) provides some promising results, but falls short when it comes to ease of use and overcoming analysis evasion. In this regard, we propose a two-fold contribution. First, we introduce COBAI (Complex Orchestrator for Binary Analysis and Instrumentation), a DBI framework designed for malware analysis, prioritizing ease-of-use and analysis transparency, without imposing a significant overhead. Second, we introduce an aggregated test suite intended to stand as a benchmark in determining the quality of an analysis solution regarding the protection against evasion mechanisms. The efficiency of our solution is validated by a careful evaluation taking into consideration other DBI frameworks, analysis environments, and the proposed benchmark.

> Machine learning is becoming increasingly popular as a go-to approach for many tasks due to its world-class results. As a result, antivirus developers are incorporating machine learning models into their products. While these models improve malware detection capabilities, they also carry the disadvantage of being susceptible to adversarial attacks. Although this vulnerability has been demonstrated for many models in white-box settings, a black-box attack is more applicable in practice for the domain of malware detection. We present a generator of adversarial malware examples using reinforcement learning algorithms. The reinforcement learning agents utilize a set of functionality-preserving modifications, thus creating valid adversarial examples. Using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm, we achieved an evasion rate of 53.84% against the gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) model. The PPO agent previously trained against the GBDT classifier scored an evasion rate of 11.41% against the neural network-based classifier MalConv and an average evasion rate of 2.31% against top antivirus programs. Furthermore, we discovered that random application of our functionality-preserving portable executable modifications successfully evades leading antivirus engines, with an average evasion rate of 11.65%. These findings indicate that machine learning-based models used in malware detection systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and that better safeguards need to be taken to protect these systems.

> Binary code similarity detection (BCSD) has various applications, including but not limited to vulnerability detection, plagiarism detection, and malware detection. Previous research efforts mainly focus on transforming binary code to assembly code strings using reverse compilation and then using pre-trained deep learning models with large parameters to obtain feature representation vector of binary code. While these models have proven to be effective in representing binary code, their large parameter size leads to considerable computational expenses during both training and inference. In this paper, we present a lightweight neural network, called FastBCSD, that employs a dynamic instruction vector encoding method and takes only assembly code as input feature to achieve comparable accuracy to the pre-training models while reducing the computational resources and time cost.   On the BinaryCorp dataset, our method achieves a similar average MRR score to the state-of-the-art pre-training-based method (jTrans), while on the BinaryCorp 3M dataset, our method even outperforms the latest technology by 0.01. Notably, FastBCSD has a much smaller parameter size (13.4M) compared to jTrans (87.88M), and its latency time is 1/5 of jTrans on NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti.

> As machine learning and deep learning models become ubiquitous, it is inevitable that there will be attempts to exploit such models in various attack scenarios. For example, in a steganographic-based attack, information could be hidden in a learning model, which might then be used to distribute malware, or for other malicious purposes. In this research, we consider the steganographic capacity of several learning models. Specifically, we train a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Transformer model on a challenging malware classification problem. For each of the resulting models, we determine the number of low-order bits of the trained parameters that can be altered without significantly affecting the performance of the model. We find that the steganographic capacity of the learning models tested is surprisingly high, and that in each case, there is a clear threshold after which model performance rapidly degrades.

> Cybersecurity solutions have shown promising performance when detecting ransomware samples that use fixed algorithms and encryption rates. However, due to the current explosion of Artificial Intelligence (AI), sooner than later, ransomware (and malware in general) will incorporate AI techniques to intelligently and dynamically adapt its encryption behavior to be undetected. It might result in ineffective and obsolete cybersecurity solutions, but the literature lacks AI-powered ransomware to verify it. Thus, this work proposes RansomAI, a Reinforcement Learning-based framework that can be integrated into existing ransomware samples to adapt their encryption behavior and stay stealthy while encrypting files. RansomAI presents an agent that learns the best encryption algorithm, rate, and duration that minimizes its detection (using a reward mechanism and a fingerprinting intelligent detection system) while maximizing its damage function. The proposed framework was validated in a ransomware, Ransomware-PoC, that infected a Raspberry Pi 4, acting as a crowdsensor. A pool of experiments with Deep Q-Learning and Isolation Forest (deployed on the agent and detection system, respectively) has demonstrated that RansomAI evades the detection of Ransomware-PoC affecting the Raspberry Pi 4 in a few minutes with >90% accuracy.

> Ransomware has remained one of the most notorious threats in the cybersecurity field. Moving Target Defense (MTD) has been proposed as a novel paradigm for proactive defense. Although various approaches leverage MTD, few of them rely on the operating system and, specifically, the file system, thereby making them dependent on other computing devices. Furthermore, existing ransomware defense techniques merely replicate or detect attacks, without preventing them. Thus, this paper introduces the MTFS overlay file system and the design and implementation of three novel MTD techniques implemented on top of it. One delaying attackers, one trapping recursive directory traversal, and another one hiding file types. The effectiveness of the techniques are shown in two experiments. First, it is shown that the techniques can delay and mitigate ransomware on real IoT devices. Secondly, in a broader scope, the solution was confronted with 14 ransomware samples, highlighting that it can save 97% of the files.

> Time-relevant and accurate threat information from public domains are essential for cyber security. In a constantly evolving threat landscape, such information assists security researchers in thwarting attack strategies. In this work, we collect and analyze threat-related information from Twitter to extract intelligence for proactive security. We first use a convolutional neural network to classify the tweets as containing or not valuable threat indicators. In particular, to gather threat intelligence from social media, the proposed approach collects pertinent Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) from tweets, such as IP addresses, URLs, File hashes, domain addresses, and CVE IDs. Then, we analyze the IoCs to confirm whether they are reliable and valuable for threat intelligence using performance indicators, such as correctness, timeliness, and overlap. We also evaluate how fast Twitter shares IoCs compared to existing threat intelligence services. Furthermore, through machine learning models, we classify Twitter accounts as either automated or human-operated and delve into the role of bot accounts in disseminating cyber threat information on social media. Our results demonstrate that Twitter is growing into a powerful platform for gathering precise and pertinent malware IoCs and a reliable source for mining threat intelligence.

> Measuring and evaluating source code similarity is a fundamental software engineering activity that embraces a broad range of applications, including but not limited to code recommendation, duplicate code, plagiarism, malware, and smell detection. This paper proposes a systematic literature review and meta-analysis on code similarity measurement and evaluation techniques to shed light on the existing approaches and their characteristics in different applications. We initially found over 10000 articles by querying four digital libraries and ended up with 136 primary studies in the field. The studies were classified according to their methodology, programming languages, datasets, tools, and applications. A deep investigation reveals 80 software tools, working with eight different techniques on five application domains. Nearly 49% of the tools work on Java programs and 37% support C and C++, while there is no support for many programming languages. A noteworthy point was the existence of 12 datasets related to source code similarity measurement and duplicate codes, of which only eight datasets were publicly accessible. The lack of reliable datasets, empirical evaluations, hybrid methods, and focuses on multi-paradigm languages are the main challenges in the field. Emerging applications of code similarity measurement concentrate on the development phase in addition to the maintenance.

- *Aqib Rashid, Jose Such*

- `2302.10739v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10739v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.10739v3)

> ML models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial query attacks. In these attacks, queries are iteratively perturbed towards a particular class without any knowledge of the target model besides its output. The prevalence of remotely-hosted ML classification models and Machine-Learning-as-a-Service platforms means that query attacks pose a real threat to the security of these systems. To deal with this, stateful defenses have been proposed to detect query attacks and prevent the generation of adversarial examples by monitoring and analyzing the sequence of queries received by the system. Several stateful defenses have been proposed in recent years. However, these defenses rely solely on similarity or out-of-distribution detection methods that may be effective in other domains. In the malware detection domain, the methods to generate adversarial examples are inherently different, and therefore we find that such detection mechanisms are significantly less effective. Hence, in this paper, we present MalProtect, which is a stateful defense against query attacks in the malware detection domain. MalProtect uses several threat indicators to detect attacks. Our results show that it reduces the evasion rate of adversarial query attacks by 80+\% in Android and Windows malware, across a range of attacker scenarios. In the first evaluation of its kind, we show that MalProtect outperforms prior stateful defenses, especially under the peak adversarial threat.

> Undoubtedly, the evolution of Generative AI (GenAI) models has been the highlight of digital transformation in the year 2022. As the different GenAI models like ChatGPT and Google Bard continue to foster their complexity and capability, it's critical to understand its consequences from a cybersecurity perspective. Several instances recently have demonstrated the use of GenAI tools in both the defensive and offensive side of cybersecurity, and focusing on the social, ethical and privacy implications this technology possesses. This research paper highlights the limitations, challenges, potential risks, and opportunities of GenAI in the domain of cybersecurity and privacy. The work presents the vulnerabilities of ChatGPT, which can be exploited by malicious users to exfiltrate malicious information bypassing the ethical constraints on the model. This paper demonstrates successful example attacks like Jailbreaks, reverse psychology, and prompt injection attacks on the ChatGPT. The paper also investigates how cyber offenders can use the GenAI tools in developing cyber attacks, and explore the scenarios where ChatGPT can be used by adversaries to create social engineering attacks, phishing attacks, automated hacking, attack payload generation, malware creation, and polymorphic malware. This paper then examines defense techniques and uses GenAI tools to improve security measures, including cyber defense automation, reporting, threat intelligence, secure code generation and detection, attack identification, developing ethical guidelines, incidence response plans, and malware detection. We will also discuss the social, legal, and ethical implications of ChatGPT. In conclusion, the paper highlights open challenges and future directions to make this GenAI secure, safe, trustworthy, and ethical as the community understands its cybersecurity impacts.

> Differentiating malware is important to determine their behaviors and level of threat; as well as to devise defensive strategy against them. In response, various anti-malware systems have been developed to distinguish between different malwares. However, most of the recent malware families are Artificial Intelligence (AI) enable and can deceive traditional anti-malware systems using different obfuscation techniques. Therefore, only AI-enabled anti-malware system is robust against these techniques and can detect different features in the malware files that aid in malicious activities. In this study we review two AI-enabled techniques for detecting malware in Windows and Android operating system, respectively. Both the techniques achieved perfect accuracy in detecting various malware families.

> Many different machine learning and deep learning techniques have been successfully employed for malware detection and classification. Examples of popular learning techniques in the malware domain include Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Random Forests (RF), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. In this research, we consider a hybrid architecture, where HMMs are trained on opcode sequences, and the resulting hidden states of these trained HMMs are used as feature vectors in various classifiers. In this context, extracting the HMM hidden state sequences can be viewed as a form of feature engineering that is somewhat analogous to techniques that are commonly employed in Natural Language Processing (NLP). We find that this NLP-based approach outperforms other popular techniques on a challenging malware dataset, with an HMM-Random Forrest model yielding the best results.

> This paper investigates the impact of feature encoding techniques on the explainability of XAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence) algorithms. Using a malware classification dataset, we trained an XGBoost model and compared the performance of two feature encoding methods: Label Encoding (LE) and One Hot Encoding (OHE). Our findings reveal a marginal performance loss when using OHE instead of LE. However, the more detailed explanations provided by OHE compensated for this loss. We observed that OHE enables deeper exploration of details in both global and local contexts, facilitating more comprehensive answers. Additionally, we observed that using OHE resulted in smaller explanation files and reduced analysis time for human analysts. These findings emphasize the significance of considering feature encoding techniques in XAI research and suggest potential for further exploration by incorporating additional encoding methods and innovative visualization approaches.

> Deep learning technology has made great achievements in the field of image. In order to defend against malware attacks, researchers have proposed many Windows malware detection models based on deep learning. However, deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial example attacks. Malware can generate adversarial malware with the same malicious function to attack the malware detection model and evade detection of the model. Currently, many adversarial defense studies have been proposed, but existing adversarial defense studies are based on image sample and cannot be directly applied to malware sample. Therefore, this paper proposes an adversarial malware defense method based on adversarial training. This method uses preprocessing to defend simple adversarial examples to reduce the difficulty of adversarial training. Moreover, this method improves the adversarial defense capability of the model through adversarial training. We experimented with three attack methods in two sets of datasets, and the results show that the method in this paper can improve the adversarial defense capability of the model without reducing the accuracy of the model.

> IoT technology has been developing rapidly, while at the same time, notorious IoT malware such as Mirai is a severe and inherent threat. We believe it is essential to consider systems that enable us to remotely control infected devices in order to prevent or limit malicious behaviors of infected devices. In this paper, we design a promising candidate for such remote-control systems, called IoT-REX (REmote-Control System for IoT devices). IoT-REX allows a systems manager to designate an arbitrary subset of all IoT devices in the system, and every device can confirm whether or not the device itself was designated; if so, the device executes a command given by the systems manager. Towards realizing IoT-REX, we introduce a novel cryptographic primitive called centralized multi-designated verifier signatures (CMDVS). Although CMDVS works under a restricted condition compared to conventional MDVS, it is sufficient for realizing IoT-REX. We provide an efficient CMDVS construction from any approximate membership query structures and digital signatures, yielding compact communication sizes and efficient verification procedures for IoT-REX. We then discuss the feasibility of IoT-REX through the cryptographic implementation of the CMDVS construction on a Raspberry Pi. Our promising results demonstrate that the CMDVS construction can compress communication size to about 30% compared to a trivial construction, and thus its resulting IoT-REX becomes three times faster than a trivial construction over typical low-power wide area networks with an IoT device.

> Public and commercial organizations extensively share cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) to prepare systems to defend against existing and emerging cyberattacks. However, traditional CTI has primarily focused on tracking known threat indicators such as IP addresses and domain names, which may not provide long-term value in defending against evolving attacks. To address this challenge, we propose to use more robust threat intelligence signals called attack patterns. LADDER is a knowledge extraction framework that can extract text-based attack patterns from CTI reports at scale. The framework characterizes attack patterns by capturing the phases of an attack in Android and enterprise networks and systematically maps them to the MITRE ATT\&CK pattern framework. LADDER can be used by security analysts to determine the presence of attack vectors related to existing and emerging threats, enabling them to prepare defenses proactively. We also present several use cases to demonstrate the application of LADDER in real-world scenarios. Finally, we provide a new, open-access benchmark malware dataset to train future cyberthreat intelligence models.

> As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to evolve, smartphones have become essential components of IoT systems. However, with the increasing amount of personal information stored on smartphones, user privacy is at risk of being compromised by malicious attackers. Although malware detection engines are commonly installed on smartphones against these attacks, attacks that can evade these defenses may still emerge. In this paper, we analyze the return values of system calls on Android smartphones and find two never-disclosed vulnerable return values that can leak fine-grained user behaviors. Based on this observation, we present EavesDroid, an application-embedded side-channel attack on Android smartphones that allows unprivileged attackers to accurately identify fine-grained user behaviors (e.g., viewing messages and playing videos) via on-screen operations. Our attack relies on the correlation between user behaviors and the return values associated with hardware and system resources. While this attack is challenging since these return values are susceptible to fluctuation and misalignment caused by many factors, we show that attackers can eavesdrop on fine-grained user behaviors using a CNN-GRU classification model that adopts min-max normalization and multiple return value fusion. Our experiments on different models and versions of Android smartphones demonstrate that EavesDroid can achieve 98% and 86% inference accuracy for 17 classes of user behaviors in the test set and real-world settings, highlighting the risk of our attack on user privacy. Finally, we recommend effective malware detection, carefully designed obfuscation methods, or restrictions on reading vulnerable return values to mitigate this attack.

> Man-at-the-end (MATE) attackers have full control over the system on which the attacked software runs, and try to break the confidentiality or integrity of assets embedded in the software. Both companies and malware authors want to prevent such attacks. This has driven an arms race between attackers and defenders, resulting in a plethora of different protection and analysis methods. However, it remains difficult to measure the strength of protections because MATE attackers can reach their goals in many different ways and a universally accepted evaluation methodology does not exist. This survey systematically reviews the evaluation methodologies of papers on obfuscation, a major class of protections against MATE attacks. For 572 papers, we collected 113 aspects of their evaluation methodologies, ranging from sample set types and sizes, over sample treatment, to performed measurements. We provide detailed insights into how the academic state of the art evaluates both the protections and analyses thereon. In summary, there is a clear need for better evaluation methodologies. We identify nine challenges for software protection evaluations, which represent threats to the validity, reproducibility, and interpretation of research results in the context of MATE attacks.

> Cloud providers' support for network evasion techniques that misrepresent the server's domain name is more prevalent than previously believed, which has serious implications for security and privacy due to the reliance on domain names in common security architectures. Domain fronting is one such evasive technique used by privacy enhancing technologies and malware to hide the domains they visit, and it uses shared hosting and HTTPS to present a benign domain to observers while signaling the target domain in the encrypted HTTP request. In this paper, we construct an ontology of domain name misinformation and detail a novel measurement methodology to identify support among cloud infrastructure providers. Despite several of the largest cloud providers having publicly stated that they no longer support domain fronting, our findings demonstrate a more complex environment with many exceptions.   We also present a novel and straightforward attack that allows an adversary to man-in-the-middle all the victim's encrypted traffic bound to a content delivery network that supports domain fronting, breaking the authenticity, confidentiality, and integrity guarantees expected by the victim when using HTTPS. By using dynamic linker hijacking to rewrite the HTTP Host field, our attack does not generate any artifacts that are visible to the victim or passive network monitoring solutions, and the attacker does not need a separate channel to exfiltrate data or perform command-and-control, which can be achieved by rewriting HTTP headers.

> Effective and efficient malware detection is at the forefront of research into building secure digital systems. As with many other fields, malware detection research has seen a dramatic increase in the application of machine learning algorithms. One machine learning technique that has been used widely in the field of pattern matching in general-and malware detection in particular-is hidden Markov models (HMMs). HMM training is based on a hill climb, and hence we can often improve a model by training multiple times with different initial values. In this research, we compare boosted HMMs (using AdaBoost) to HMMs trained with multiple random restarts, in the context of malware detection. These techniques are applied to a variety of challenging malware datasets. We find that random restarts perform surprisingly well in comparison to boosting. Only in the most difficult "cold start" cases (where training data is severely limited) does boosting appear to offer sufficient improvement to justify its higher computational cost in the scoring phase.

We collect a second dataset and discover that 91% of prices fall between 1--20 US dollars, with a median of 5 US dollars.   Database Market sells access to compromised online accounts.

> In the digitized world, smartphones and their apps play an important role. To name just a few examples, some apps offer possibilities for entertainment, others for online banking, and others offer support for two-factor authentication. Therefore, with smartphones also, sensitive information is shared; thus, they are a desirable target for malware. The following technical report gives an overview of how machine learning, especially neural networks, can be employed to detect malicious Android apps based on their metadata. Detection based on the metadata is necessary since not all of an app's information is readable from another app due to the security layout of Android. To do so, a comparable big dataset of metadata of apps has been collected for learning and evaluation in this work. The first section, after the introduction, presents the related work, followed by the description of the sources of the dataset and the selection of the features used for machine learning, in this case, only the app permissions. Afterward, a free available dataset is used to find an efficient and effective neural network model for learning and evaluation. Here, the fully connected network type consisting of dense layers is chosen. Then this model is trained and evaluated on the new, more extensive dataset to obtain a representative result. It turns out that this model detects malware with an accuracy of 92.93% based on an app's permissions.

> Machine learning and neural networks have become increasingly popular solutions for encrypted malware traffic detection. They mine and learn complex traffic patterns, enabling detection by fitting boundaries between malware traffic and benign traffic. Compared with signature-based methods, they have higher scalability and flexibility. However, affected by the frequent variants and updates of malware, current methods suffer from a high false positive rate and do not work well for unknown malware traffic detection. It remains a critical task to achieve effective malware traffic detection. In this paper, we introduce CBSeq to address the above problems. CBSeq is a method that constructs a stable traffic representation, behavior sequence, to characterize attacking intent and achieve malware traffic detection. We novelly propose the channels with similar behavior as the detection object and extract side-channel content to construct behavior sequence. Unlike benign activities, the behavior sequences of malware and its variant's traffic exhibit solid internal correlations. Moreover, we design the MSFormer, a powerful Transformer-based multi-sequence fusion classifier. It captures the internal similarity of behavior sequence, thereby distinguishing malware traffic from benign traffic. Our evaluations demonstrate that CBSeq performs effectively in various known malware traffic detection and exhibits superior performance in unknown malware traffic detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

> The increasing popularity of certain programming languages has spurred the creation of ecosystem-specific package repositories and package managers. Such repositories (e.g., NPM, PyPI) serve as public databases that users can query to retrieve packages for various functionalities, whereas package managers automatically handle dependency resolution and package installation on the client side. These mechanisms enhance software modularization and accelerate implementation. However, they have become a target for malicious actors seeking to propagate malware on a large scale.   In this work, we show how attackers can leverage capabilities of popular package managers and languages to achieve arbitrary code execution on victim machines, thereby realizing open-source software supply chain attacks. Based on the analysis of 7 ecosystems, we identify 3 install-time and 5 runtime techniques, and we provide recommendations describing how to reduce the risk when consuming third-party dependencies. We will provide proof-of-concepts that demonstrate the identified techniques. Furthermore, we describe evasion strategies employed by attackers to circumvent detection mechanisms.

> Background: Software security is crucial to ensure that the users are protected from undesirable consequences such as malware attacks which can result in loss of data and, subsequently, financial loss. Technical Debt (TD) is a metaphor incurred by suboptimal decisions resulting in long-term consequences such as increased defects and vulnerabilities if not managed. Although previous studies have studied the relationship between security and TD, examining their intersection in developers' discussion on Stack Overflow (SO) is still unexplored. Aims: This study investigates the characteristics of security-related TD questions on SO. More specifically, we explore the prevalence of TD in security-related queries, identify the security tags most prone to TD, and investigate which user groups are more aware of TD. Method: We mined 117,233 security-related questions on SO and used a deep-learning approach to identify 45,078 security-related TD questions. Subsequently, we conducted quantitative and qualitative analyses of the collected security-related TD questions, including sentiment analysis. Results: Our analysis revealed that 38% of the security questions on SO are security-related TD questions. The most recurrent tags among the security-related TD questions emerged as "security" and "encryption." The latter typically have a neutral sentiment, are lengthier, and are posed by users with higher reputation scores. Conclusions: Our findings reveal that developers implicitly discuss TD, suggesting developers have a potential knowledge gap regarding the TD metaphor in the security domain. Moreover, we identified the most common security topics mentioned in TD-related posts, providing valuable insights for developers and researchers to assist developers in prioritizing security concerns in order to minimize TD and enhance software security.

> Data protection is the process of securing sensitive information from being corrupted, compromised, or lost. A hyperconnected network, on the other hand, is a computer networking trend in which communication occurs over a network. However, what about malware. Malware is malicious software meant to penetrate private data, threaten a computer system, or gain unauthorised network access without the users consent. Due to the increasing applications of computers and dependency on electronically saved private data, malware attacks on sensitive information have become a dangerous issue for individuals and organizations across the world. Hence, malware defense is critical for keeping our computer systems and data protected. Many recent survey articles have focused on either malware detection systems or single attacking strategies variously. To the best of our knowledge, no survey paper demonstrates malware attack patterns and defense strategies combinedly. Through this survey, this paper aims to address this issue by merging diverse malicious attack patterns and machine learning (ML) based detection models for modern and sophisticated malware. In doing so, we focus on the taxonomy of malware attack patterns based on four fundamental dimensions the primary goal of the attack, method of attack, targeted exposure and execution process, and types of malware that perform each attack. Detailed information on malware analysis approaches is also investigated. In addition, existing malware detection techniques employing feature extraction and ML algorithms are discussed extensively. Finally, it discusses research difficulties and unsolved problems, including future research directions.

> With the advance in malware technology, attackers create new ways to hide their malicious code from antivirus services. One way to obfuscate an attack is to use common files as cover to hide the malicious scripts, so the malware will look like a legitimate file. Although cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence and content signature exist, evasive malware successfully bypasses next-generation malware detection using advanced methods like steganography. Some of the files commonly used to hide malware are image files (e.g., JPEG). In addition, some malware use steganography to hide malicious scripts or sensitive data in images. Steganography in images is difficult to detect even with specialized tools. Image-based attacks try to attack the user's device using malicious payloads or utilize image steganography to hide sensitive data inside legitimate images and leak it outside the user's device. Therefore in this paper, we present a novel Image Content Disarm and Reconstruction (ICDR). Our ICDR system removes potential malware, with a zero trust approach, while maintaining high image quality and file usability. By extracting the image data, removing it from the rest of the file, and manipulating the image pixels, it is possible to disable or remove the hidden malware inside the file.

> Many studies have proposed machine-learning (ML) models for malware detection and classification, reporting an almost-perfect performance. However, they assemble ground-truth in different ways, use diverse static- and dynamic-analysis techniques for feature extraction, and even differ on what they consider a malware family. As a consequence, our community still lacks an understanding of malware classification results: whether they are tied to the nature and distribution of the collected dataset, to what extent the number of families and samples in the training dataset influence performance, and how well static and dynamic features complement each other.   This work sheds light on those open questions. by investigating the key factors influencing ML-based malware detection and classification. For this, we collect the largest balanced malware dataset so far with 67K samples from 670 families (100 samples each), and train state-of-the-art models for malware detection and family classification using our dataset. Our results reveal that static features perform better than dynamic features, and that combining both only provides marginal improvement over static features. We discover no correlation between packing and classification accuracy, and that missing behaviors in dynamically-extracted features highly penalize their performance. We also demonstrate how a larger number of families to classify make the classification harder, while a higher number of samples per family increases accuracy. Finally, we find that models trained on a uniform distribution of samples per family better generalize on unseen data.

Leakage can occur due to a malware infection or the use of a weakly privacy-preserving matcher, exemplified by side channel attacks or partially obfuscated designs. We provide an exhaustive catalog of information leakage scenarios as well as their impacts on the security concerning data privacy. Each of the scenarios leads to generic attacks whose impacts are expressed in terms of computational costs, hence allowing the establishment of upper bounds on the security level.

> There is a growing trend of cyberattacks against Internet of Things (IoT) devices; moreover, the sophistication and motivation of those attacks is increasing. The vast scale of IoT, diverse hardware and software, and being typically placed in uncontrolled environments make traditional IT security mechanisms such as signature-based intrusion detection and prevention systems challenging to integrate. They also struggle to cope with the rapidly evolving IoT threat landscape due to long delays between the analysis and publication of the detection rules. Machine learning methods have shown faster response to emerging threats; however, model training architectures like cloud or edge computing face multiple drawbacks in IoT settings, including network overhead and data isolation arising from the large scale and heterogeneity that characterizes these networks.   This work presents an architecture for training unsupervised models for network intrusion detection in large, distributed IoT and Industrial IoT (IIoT) deployments. We leverage Federated Learning (FL) to collaboratively train between peers and reduce isolation and network overhead problems. We build upon it to include an unsupervised device clustering algorithm fully integrated into the FL pipeline to address the heterogeneity issues that arise in FL settings. The architecture is implemented and evaluated using a testbed that includes various emulated IoT/IIoT devices and attackers interacting in a complex network topology comprising 100 emulated devices, 30 switches and 10 routers. The anomaly detection models are evaluated on real attacks performed by the testbed's threat actors, including the entire Mirai malware lifecycle, an additional botnet based on the Merlin command and control server and other red-teaming tools performing scanning activities and multiple attacks targeting the emulated devices.

> Several solutions ensuring the dynamic detection of malicious activities on Android ecosystem have been proposed. These are represented by generic rules and models that identify any purported malicious behavior. However, the approaches adopted are far from being effective in detecting malware (listed or not) and whose form and behavior are likely to be different depending on the execution environment or the design of the malware itself (polymorphic for example). An additional difficulty is added when these approaches are unable to capture, analyze, and classify all the execution paths incorporated in the analyzed application earlier. This suggests that the functionality of the analyzed application can constitute a potential risk but never explored or revealed. We have studied some malware detection techniques based on behavioral analysis of applications. The description, characteristics, and results obtained from each technique are presented in this article wherein we have also highlighted some open problems, challenges as well as the different possible future directions of research concerning behavioral analysis of malware.

> Transformer-based models have revolutionized the performance of a wide range of language tasks. Intuitively, one might expect text classification, which does not necessitate as many high-level representations as generative tasks, to be comprehensively addressed with the powerful representation capabilities of Transformers. However, in reality, there remains significant potential for enhancement, particularly in the areas of multi-class and multi-label classification of lengthy textual documents and other large files. The performance of Transformer-based models is mainly hindered by a major limitation: a restricted input length, e.g., 512 tokens for BERT. While an increase in GPU memory can marginally extend this limit, practical real-world applications often operate under constrained GPU resources. In this work, we tackle the input limit problem from the perspective of correlated multiple instance learning. The proposed approach, LaFiCMIL, serves as a versatile framework applicable to various large file classification tasks covering binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification tasks, spanning various domains including Natural Language Processing, Programming Language Processing, and Android Analysis. To evaluate its effectiveness, we employ eight benchmark datasets pertaining to Long Document Classification, Code Defect Detection, and Android Malware Detection. Leveraging BERT-family models as feature extractors, our experimental results demonstrate that LaFiCMIL achieves new state-of-the-art performance across all benchmark datasets. This is largely attributable to its capability of scaling BERT up to nearly 20K tokens, running on a single Tesla V-100 GPU with 32G of memory.

> Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), such as IP addresses, file hashes, and domain names associated with known malware or attacks, are cornerstones of cybersecurity, serving to identify malicious activity on a network. In this work, we leverage real data to compare different parameterizations of IOC aging models. Our dataset comprises traffic at a real environment for more than 1 year. Among our trace-driven findings, we determine thresholds for the ratio between miss over monitoring costs such that the system benefits from storing IOCs for a finite time-to-live (TTL) before eviction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real world evaluation of thresholds related to IOC aging, paving the way towards realistic IOC decaying models.

> Phishing PDFs are malicious PDF documents that do not embed malware but trick victims into visiting malicious web pages leading to password theft or drive-by downloads. While recent reports indicate a surge of phishing PDFs, prior works have largely neglected this new threat, positioning phishing PDFs as accessories distributed via email phishing campaigns.   This paper challenges this belief and presents the first systematic and comprehensive study centered on phishing PDFs. Starting from a real-world dataset, we first identify 44 phishing PDF campaigns via clustering and characterize them by looking at their volumetric, temporal, and visual features. Among these, we identify three large campaigns covering 89% of the dataset, exhibiting significantly different volumetric and temporal properties compared to classical email phishing, and relying on web UI elements as visual baits. Finally, we look at the distribution vectors and show that phishing PDFs are not only distributed via attachments but also via SEO attacks, placing phishing PDFs outside the email distribution ecosystem.   This paper also assesses the usefulness of the VirusTotal scoring system, showing that phishing PDFs are ranked considerably low, creating a blind spot for organizations. While URL blocklists can help to prevent victims from visiting the attack web pages, PDF documents seem not subjected to any form of content-based filtering or detection.

> Binary similarity detection is a critical technique that has been applied in many real-world scenarios where source code is not available, e.g., bug search, malware analysis, and code plagiarism detection. Existing works are ineffective in detecting similar binaries in cases where different compiling optimizations, compilers, source code versions, or obfuscation are deployed.   We observe that all the cases do not change a binary's key code behaviors although they significantly modify its syntax and structure. With this key observation, we extract a set of key instructions from a binary to capture its key code behaviors. By detecting the similarity between two binaries' key instructions, we can address well the ineffectiveness limitation of existing works. Specifically, we translate each extracted key instruction into a self-defined key expression, generating a key-semantics graph based on the binary's control flow. Each node in the key-semantics graph denotes a key instruction, and the node attribute is the key expression. To quantify the similarity between two given key-semantics graphs, we first serialize each graph into a sequence of key expressions by topological sort. Then, we tokenize and concatenate key expressions to generate token lists. We calculate the locality-sensitive hash value for all token lists and quantify their similarity. %We implement a prototype, called SemDiff, consisting of two modules: graph generation and graph diffing. The first module generates a pair of key-semantics graphs and the second module diffs the graphs. Our evaluation results show that overall, SemDiff outperforms state-of-the-art tools when detecting the similarity of binaries generated from different optimization levels, compilers, and obfuscations. SemDiff is also effective for library version search and finding similar vulnerabilities in firmware.

> A large amount of new malware is constantly being generated, which must not only be distinguished from benign samples, but also classified into malware families. For this purpose, investigating how existing malware families are developed and examining emerging families need to be explored. This paper focuses on the online processing of incoming malicious samples to assign them to existing families or, in the case of samples from new families, to cluster them. We experimented with seven prevalent malware families from the EMBER dataset, four in the training set and three additional new families in the test set. Based on the classification score of the multilayer perceptron, we determined which samples would be classified and which would be clustered into new malware families. We classified 97.21% of streaming data with a balanced accuracy of 95.33%. Then, we clustered the remaining data using a self-organizing map, achieving a purity from 47.61% for four clusters to 77.68% for ten clusters. These results indicate that our approach has the potential to be applied to the classification and clustering of zero-day malware into malware families.

> Self-propagating malware (SPM) has recently resulted in large financial losses and high social impact, with well-known campaigns such as WannaCry and Colonial Pipeline being able to propagate rapidly on the Internet and cause service disruptions. To date, the propagation behavior of SPM is still not well understood, resulting in the difficulty of defending against these cyber threats. To address this gap, in this paper we perform a comprehensive analysis of a newly proposed epidemiological model for SPM propagation, Susceptible-Infected-Infected Dormant-Recovered (SIIDR). We perform a theoretical analysis of the stability of the SIIDR model and derive its basic reproduction number by representing it as a system of Ordinary Differential Equations with continuous time. We obtain access to 15 WananCry attack traces generated under various conditions, derive the model's transition rates, and show that SIIDR fits best the real data. We find that the SIIDR model outperforms more established compartmental models from epidemiology, such as SI, SIS, and SIR, at modeling SPM propagation.

> As mobile and smart connectivity continue to grow, malware presents a permanently evolving threat to different types of critical domains such as health, logistics, banking, and community segments. Different types of malware have dynamic behaviors and complicated characteristics that are shared among members of the same malware family. Malware threat intelligence reports play a crucial role in describing and documenting the detected malware, providing a wealth of information regarding its attributes, patterns, and behaviors. There is a large amount of intelligent threat information regarding malware. The ontology allows the systematic organization and categorization of this information to ensure consistency in representing concepts and entities across various sources. In this study, we reviewed and extended an existing malware ontology to cover Android malware. Our extended ontology is called AndMalOnt. It consisted of 13 new classes, 16 object properties, and 31 data properties. Second, we created an Android malware knowledge graph by extracting reports from the MalwareBazaar repository and representing them in AndMalOnt. This involved generating a knowledge graph that encompasses over 2600 malware samples. Our ontology, knowledge graph, and source code are all open-source and accessible via GitHub

> Malicious software is an integral part of cybercrime defense. Due to the growing number of malicious attacks and their target sources, detecting and preventing the attack becomes more challenging due to the assault's changing behavior. The bulk of classic malware detection systems is based on statistics, analytic techniques, or machine learning. Virus signature methods are widely used to identify malware. The bulk of anti-malware systems categorizes malware using regular expressions and patterns. While antivirus software is less likely to update its databases to identify and block malware, file features must be updated to detect and prevent newly generated malware. Creating attack signatures requires practically all of a human being's work. The purpose of this study is to undertake a review of the current research on intrusion detection models and the datasets that support them. In this article, we discuss the state-of-the-art, focusing on the strategy that was devised and executed, the dataset that was utilized, the findings, and the assessment that was undertaken. Additionally, the surveyed articles undergo critical analysis and statements in order to give a thorough comparative review. Machine learning and deep learning methods, as well as new classification and feature selection methodologies, are studied and researched. Thus far, each technique has proved the capability of constructing very accurate intrusion detection models. The survey findings reveal that Clearly, the MultiTree and adaptive voting algorithms surpassed all other models in terms of persistency and performance, averaging 99.98 percent accuracy on average.

> With the increasing number and sophistication of malware attacks, malware detection systems based on machine learning (ML) grow in importance. At the same time, many popular ML models used in malware classification are supervised solutions. These supervised classifiers often do not generalize well to novel malware. Therefore, they need to be re-trained frequently to detect new malware specimens, which can be time-consuming. Our work addresses this problem in a hybrid framework of theoretical Quantum ML, combined with feature selection strategies to reduce the data size and malware classifier training time. The preliminary results show that VQC with XGBoost selected features can get a 78.91% test accuracy on the simulator. The average accuracy for the model trained using the features selected with XGBoost was 74% (+- 11.35%) on the IBM 5 qubits machines.

> Deep learning classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance in various risk detection applications. They explore rich semantic representations and are supposed to automatically discover risk behaviors. However, due to the lack of transparency, the behavioral semantics cannot be conveyed to downstream security experts to reduce their heavy workload in security analysis. Although feature attribution (FA) methods can be used to explain deep learning, the underlying classifier is still blind to what behavior is suspicious, and the generated explanation cannot adapt to downstream tasks, incurring poor explanation fidelity and intelligibility. In this paper, we propose FINER, the first framework for risk detection classifiers to generate high-fidelity and high-intelligibility explanations. The high-level idea is to gather explanation efforts from model developer, FA designer, and security experts. To improve fidelity, we fine-tune the classifier with an explanation-guided multi-task learning strategy. To improve intelligibility, we engage task knowledge to adjust and ensemble FA methods. Extensive evaluations show that FINER improves explanation quality for risk detection. Moreover, we demonstrate that FINER outperforms a state-of-the-art tool in facilitating malware analysis.

> The LockBit 3.0 ransomware variant is arguably the most threatening of malware in recent times. With no regard for a victim's industry, the ransomware has undergone several evolutions to arrive at an adaptable and evasive variant which has been a menace to governments and organisations, recently infiltrating Advanced Computer Software group. Previous LockBit studies mostly concentrated on measuring the impact of the ransomware attack, prevention, encryption detection, decryption, or data recovery, thereby providing little or no benefit to the less tech savvy populace as a detailed breakdown of the mode of attack is rarely examined. This article analyses the LockBit 3.0 attack techniques with a contextual illustration of the attack on Advanced Computer Software group. With the NHS being a major client of the organisation, and its services alongside 15 other clients being crippled for hours during the attack, attention is drawn to how dreadful such disruption may be in critical organisations. We observed that the upgrade of Lockbit based on releasing newer versions is in a bid to continuously ensure the malware's efficiency - a virtue that keeps it at the zenith - by staying ahead of improved defenses. Our study highlights social engineering as a vibrant portal to Lockbit's maliciousness and indicates an investment in detection systems may profit more than in prevention systems. Therefore, further research should consider improving detection systems against Lockbit 3.0.

> The expansion of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm is inevitable, but vulnerabilities of IoT devices to malware incidents have become an increasing concern. Recent research has shown that the integration of Reinforcement Learning with Moving Target Defense (MTD) mechanisms can enhance cybersecurity in IoT devices. Nevertheless, the numerous new malware attacks and the time that agents take to learn and select effective MTD techniques make this approach impractical for real-world IoT scenarios. To tackle this issue, this work presents CyberForce, a framework that employs Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) to collectively and privately determine suitable MTD techniques for mitigating diverse zero-day attacks. CyberForce integrates device fingerprinting and anomaly detection to reward or penalize MTD mechanisms chosen by an FRL-based agent. The framework has been evaluated in a federation consisting of ten devices of a real IoT platform. A pool of experiments with six malware samples affecting the devices has demonstrated that CyberForce can precisely learn optimum MTD mitigation strategies. When all clients are affected by all attacks, the FRL agent exhibits high accuracy and reduced training time when compared to a centralized RL agent. In cases where different clients experience distinct attacks, the CyberForce clients gain benefits through the transfer of knowledge from other clients and similar attack behavior. Additionally, CyberForce showcases notable robustness against data poisoning attacks.

> Malware detectors based on deep learning (DL) have been shown to be susceptible to malware examples that have been deliberately manipulated in order to evade detection, a.k.a. adversarial malware examples. More specifically, it has been show that deep learning detectors are vulnerable to small changes on the input file. Given this vulnerability of deep learning detectors, we propose a practical defense against adversarial malware examples inspired by randomized smoothing. In our work, instead of employing Gaussian or Laplace noise when randomizing inputs, we propose a randomized ablation-based smoothing scheme that ablates a percentage of the bytes within an executable. During training, our randomized ablation-based smoothing scheme trains a base classifier based on ablated versions of the executable files. At test time, the final classification for a given input executable is taken as the class most commonly predicted by the classifier on a set of ablated versions of the original executable. To demonstrate the suitability of our approach we have empirically evaluated the proposed ablation-based model against various state-of-the-art evasion attacks on the BODMAS dataset. Results show greater robustness and generalization capabilities to adversarial malware examples in comparison to a non-smoothed classifier.

> Malware detection has become a major concern due to the increasing number and complexity of malware. Traditional detection methods based on signatures and heuristics are used for malware detection, but unfortunately, they suffer from poor generalization to unknown attacks and can be easily circumvented using obfuscation techniques. In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) and notably Deep Learning (DL) achieved impressive results in malware detection by learning useful representations from data and have become a solution preferred over traditional methods. More recently, the application of such techniques on graph-structured data has achieved state-of-the-art performance in various domains and demonstrates promising results in learning more robust representations from malware. Yet, no literature review focusing on graph-based deep learning for malware detection exists. In this survey, we provide an in-depth literature review to summarize and unify existing works under the common approaches and architectures. We notably demonstrate that Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) reach competitive results in learning robust embeddings from malware represented as expressive graph structures, leading to an efficient detection by downstream classifiers. This paper also reviews adversarial attacks that are utilized to fool graph-based detection methods. Challenges and future research directions are discussed at the end of the paper.

> The evolution of Generative AI and the capabilities of the newly released Large Language Models (LLMs) open new opportunities in software engineering. However, they also lead to new challenges in cybersecurity. Recently, researchers have shown the possibilities of using LLMs such as ChatGPT to generate malicious content that can directly be exploited or guide inexperienced hackers to weaponize tools and code. Those studies covered scenarios that still require the attacker in the middle of the loop. In this study, we leverage openly available plugins and use an LLM as proxy between the attacker and the victim. We deliver a proof-of-concept where ChatGPT is used for the dissemination of malicious software while evading detection, alongside establishing the communication to a command and control (C2) server to receive commands to interact with a victim's system. Finally, we present the general approach as well as essential elements in order to stay undetected and make the attack a success. This proof-of-concept highlights significant cybersecurity issues with openly available plugins and LLMs, which require the development of security guidelines, controls, and mitigation strategies.

> Since the beginning of this decade, several incidents report that false data injection attacks targeting intelligent connected vehicles cause huge industrial damage and loss of lives. Data Theft, Flooding, Fuzzing, Hijacking, Malware Spoofing and Advanced Persistent Threats have been immensely growing attack that leads to end-user conflict by abolishing trust on autonomous vehicle. Looking after those sensitive data that contributes to measure the localisation factors of the vehicle, conventional centralised techniques can be misused to update the legitimate vehicular status maliciously. As investigated, the existing centralized false data detection approach based on state and likelihood estimation has a reprehensible trade-off in terms of accuracy, trust, cost, and efficiency. Blockchain with Fuzzy-logic Intelligence has shown its potential to solve localisation issues, trust and false data detection challenges encountered by today's autonomous vehicular system. The proposed Blockchain-based fuzzy solution demonstrates a novel false data detection and reputation preservation technique. The illustrated proposed model filters false and anomalous data based on the vehicles' rules and behaviours. Besides improving the detection accuracy and eliminating the single point of failure, the contributions include appropriating fuzzy AI functions within the Road-side Unit node before authorizing status data by a Blockchain network. Finally, thorough experimental evaluation validates the effectiveness of the proposed model.

> Machine learning has proven to be a useful tool for automated malware detection, but machine learning models have also been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This article addresses the problem of generating adversarial malware samples, specifically malicious Windows Portable Executable files. We summarize and compare work that has focused on adversarial machine learning for malware detection. We use gradient-based, evolutionary algorithm-based, and reinforcement-based methods to generate adversarial samples, and then test the generated samples against selected antivirus products. We compare the selected methods in terms of accuracy and practical applicability. The results show that applying optimized modifications to previously detected malware can lead to incorrect classification of the file as benign. It is also known that generated malware samples can be successfully used against detection models other than those used to generate them and that using combinations of generators can create new samples that evade detection. Experiments show that the Gym-malware generator, which uses a reinforcement learning approach, has the greatest practical potential. This generator achieved an average sample generation time of 5.73 seconds and the highest average evasion rate of 44.11%. Using the Gym-malware generator in combination with itself improved the evasion rate to 58.35%.

> For a long time, malware classification and analysis have been an arms-race between antivirus systems and malware authors. Though static analysis is vulnerable to evasion techniques, it is still popular as the first line of defense in antivirus systems. But most of the static analyzers failed to gain the trust of practitioners due to their black-box nature. We propose MAlign, a novel static malware family classification approach inspired by genome sequence alignment that can not only classify malware families but can also provide explanations for its decision. MAlign encodes raw bytes using nucleotides and adopts genome sequence alignment approaches to create a signature of a malware family based on the conserved code segments in that family, without any human labor or expertise. We evaluate MAlign on two malware datasets, and it outperforms other state-of-the-art machine learning based malware classifiers (by 4.49% - 0.07%), especially on small datasets (by 19.48% - 1.2%). Furthermore, we explain the generated signatures by MAlign on different malware families illustrating the kinds of insights it can provide to analysts, and show its efficacy as an analysis tool. Additionally, we evaluate its theoretical and empirical robustness against some common attacks. In this paper, we approach static malware analysis from a unique perspective, aiming to strike a delicate balance among performance, interpretability, and robustness.

> This paper of work examines the SolarWinds attack, designed on Orion Platform security incident. It analyses the persistent threats agents and potential technical attack techniques to gain unauthorized access. In 2020 SolarWinds attack indicates an initial breach disclosure on Orion Platform software by malware distribution on IT and government organizations such as Homeland Security, Microsoft and Intel associated with supply chains leaks consequences from small loopholes in security systems. Hackers increased the number of infected company and businesses networks during the supply-chain attack, hackers were capable to propagate the attack by using a VMware exploit. On the special way they started to target command injections, privilege escalations, and use after free platforms of VMware. In this way, they gained access to Virtual Machines and in the east way pivot other servers. This literature review aim to analyze the security gap regarding to SolarWinds incident on Orion Platform, the impact on industry and financial sectors involving the elements of incident response plan. Therefore, this research paper ensures specifications of proper solutions for possible defense security systems by analyzing a SolarWinds attack case study via system evaluation and monitoring.

> Despite the promising results of machine learning models in malware detection, they face the problem of concept drift due to malware constant evolution. This leads to a decline in performance over time, as the data distribution of the new files differs from the training one, requiring regular model update. In this work, we propose a model-agnostic protocol to improve a baseline neural network to handle with the drift problem. We show the importance of feature reduction and training with the most recent validation set possible, and propose a loss function named Drift-Resilient Binary Cross-Entropy, an improvement to the classical Binary Cross-Entropy more effective against drift. We train our model on the EMBER dataset (2018) and evaluate it on a dataset of recent malicious files, collected between 2020 and 2023. Our improved model shows promising results, detecting 15.2% more malware than a baseline model.

> With the increasing extent of malware attacks in the present day along with the difficulty in detecting modern malware, it is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness and performance of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for malware classification. Multiple DNN architectures can be designed and trained to detect and classify malware binaries. Results demonstrate the potential of DNNs in accurately classifying malware with high accuracy rates observed across different malware types. Additionally, the feasibility of deploying these DNN models on edge devices to enable real-time classification, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios proves to be integral to large IoT systems. By optimizing model architectures and leveraging edge computing capabilities, the proposed methodologies achieve efficient performance even with limited resources. This study contributes to advancing malware detection techniques and emphasizes the significance of integrating cybersecurity measures for the early detection of malware and further preventing the adverse effects caused by such attacks. Optimal considerations regarding the distribution of security tasks to edge devices are addressed to ensure that the integrity and availability of large scale IoT systems are not compromised due to malware attacks, advocating for a more resilient and secure digital ecosystem.

> Widespread adoption and growing popularity of embedded/IoT/CPS devices make them attractive attack targets. On low-to-mid-range devices, security features are typically few or none due to various constraints. Such devices are thus subject to malware-based compromise. One popular defensive measure is Remote Attestation (RA) which allows a trusted entity to determine the current software integrity of an untrusted remote device.   For higher-end devices, RA is achievable via secure hardware components. For low-end (bare metal) devices, minimalistic hybrid (hardware/software) RA is effective, which incurs some hardware modifications. That leaves certain mid-range devices (e.g., ARM Cortex-A family) equipped with standard hardware components, e.g., a memory management unit (MMU) and perhaps a secure boot facility. In this space, seL4 (a verified microkernel with guaranteed process isolation) is a promising platform for attaining RA. HYDRA made a first step towards this, albeit without achieving any verifiability or provable guarantees.   This paper picks up where HYDRA left off by constructing a PARseL architecture, that separates all user-dependent components from the TCB. This leads to much stronger isolation guarantees, based on seL4 alone, and facilitates formal verification. In PARseL, We use formal verification to obtain several security properties for the isolated RA TCB, including: memory safety, functional correctness, and secret independence. We implement PARseL in F* and specify/prove expected properties using Hoare logic. Next, we automatically translate the F* implementation to C using KaRaMeL, which preserves verified properties of PARseL C implementation (atop seL4). Finally, we instantiate and evaluate PARseL on a commodity platform -- a SabreLite embedded device.

> Software developers typically rely upon a large network of dependencies to build their applications. For instance, the NPM package repository contains over 3 million packages and serves tens of billions of downloads weekly. Understanding the structure and nature of packages, dependencies, and published code requires datasets that provide researchers with easy access to metadata and code of packages. However, prior work on NPM dataset construction typically has two limitations: 1) only metadata is scraped, and 2) packages or versions that are deleted from NPM can not be scraped. Over 330,000 versions of packages were deleted from NPM between July 2022 and May 2023. This data is critical for researchers as it often pertains to important questions of security and malware. We present npm-follower, a dataset and crawling architecture which archives metadata and code of all packages and versions as they are published, and is thus able to retain data which is later deleted. The dataset currently includes over 35 million versions of packages, and grows at a rate of about 1 million versions per month. The dataset is designed to be easily used by researchers answering questions involving either metadata or program analysis. Both the code and dataset are available at https://dependencies.science.

> Spurred by the recent rapid increase in the development and distribution of large language models (LLMs) across industry and academia, much recent work has drawn attention to safety- and security-related threats and vulnerabilities of LLMs, including in the context of potentially criminal activities. Specifically, it has been shown that LLMs can be misused for fraud, impersonation, and the generation of malware; while other authors have considered the more general problem of AI alignment. It is important that developers and practitioners alike are aware of security-related problems with such models. In this paper, we provide an overview of existing - predominantly scientific - efforts on identifying and mitigating threats and vulnerabilities arising from LLMs. We present a taxonomy describing the relationship between threats caused by the generative capabilities of LLMs, prevention measures intended to address such threats, and vulnerabilities arising from imperfect prevention measures. With our work, we hope to raise awareness of the limitations of LLMs in light of such security concerns, among both experienced developers and novel users of such technologies.

> In the wake of the arrival of digital media, the Internet, the web, and online social media, a flood of new cyber security research questions have emerged. There is a lot of money being lost around the world because of cyber-attacks. As a result, cyber security has emerged as one of the world's most complex and pressing issues. Cyber security experts from both industry and academia institutions are now analyzing current cyber-attacks occurring around the world and developing various strategies to defend systems from possible cyber-threats and attacks. This paper examines recent cyber security attacks as well as the financial losses incurred as a result of the growing number of cyber-attacks. Our findings indicate that the majority of the research chosen for this study focused solely on a small number of widespread security flaws, such as malware, phishing, and denial-of-service attacks. A total of over 50 major studies that have been published in reputable academic journals and conferences have been chosen for additional examination. A taxonomy of cyber-attacks elements that is based on the context of use in various environments has also been suggested, in addition to a review of the most recent studies on countermeasures for cyber-attacks being the state of the art. Lastly, the research gaps in terms of open issues have been described in order to offer potential future directions for the researchers working in the field of cyber security.

> This work presents an evaluation of six prominent commercial endpoint malware detectors, a network malware detector, and a file-conviction algorithm from a cyber technology vendor. The evaluation was administered as the first of the Artificial Intelligence Applications to Autonomous Cybersecurity (AI ATAC) prize challenges, funded by / completed in service of the US Navy. The experiment employed 100K files (50/50% benign/malicious) with a stratified distribution of file types, including ~1K zero-day program executables (increasing experiment size two orders of magnitude over previous work). We present an evaluation process of delivering a file to a fresh virtual machine donning the detection technology, waiting 90s to allow static detection, then executing the file and waiting another period for dynamic detection; this allows greater fidelity in the observational data than previous experiments, in particular, resource and time-to-detection statistics. To execute all 800K trials (100K files $\times$ 8 tools), a software framework is designed to choreographed the experiment into a completely automated, time-synced, and reproducible workflow with substantial parallelization. A cost-benefit model was configured to integrate the tools' recall, precision, time to detection, and resource requirements into a single comparable quantity by simulating costs of use. This provides a ranking methodology for cyber competitions and a lens through which to reason about the varied statistical viewpoints of the results. These statistical and cost-model results provide insights on state of commercial malware detection.

> Machine learning and deep learning models are potential vectors for various attack scenarios. For example, previous research has shown that malware can be hidden in deep learning models. Hiding information in a learning model can be viewed as a form of steganography. In this research, we consider the general question of the steganographic capacity of learning models. Specifically, for a wide range of models, we determine the number of low-order bits of the trained parameters that can be overwritten, without adversely affecting model performance. For each model considered, we graph the accuracy as a function of the number of low-order bits that have been overwritten, and for selected models, we also analyze the steganographic capacity of individual layers. The models that we test include the classic machine learning techniques of Linear Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM); the popular general deep learning models of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); the highly-successful Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM); the pre-trained transfer learning-based models VGG16, DenseNet121, InceptionV3, and Xception; and, finally, an Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (ACGAN). In all cases, we find that a majority of the bits of each trained parameter can be overwritten before the accuracy degrades. Of the models tested, the steganographic capacity ranges from 7.04 KB for our LR experiments, to 44.74 MB for InceptionV3. We discuss the implications of our results and consider possible avenues for further research.

> Cyclostationarity involves periodic statistical variations in signals and processes, commonly used in signal analysis and network security. In the context of attacks, cyclostationarity helps detect malicious behaviors within network traffic, such as traffic patterns in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks or hidden communication channels in malware. This approach enhances security by identifying abnormal patterns and informing Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) to recognize potential attacks, enhancing protection against both known and novel threats. This research focuses on identifying cyclostationary malware behavior and its detection. The main goal is to pinpoint essential cyclostationary features used in NIDSs. These features are extracted using algorithms such as Boruta and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and then categorized to find the most significant cyclostationary patterns. The aim of this article is to reveal periodically changing malware behaviors through cyclostationarity. The study highlights the importance of spotting cyclostationary malware in NIDSs by using established datasets like KDD99, NSL-KDD, and the UGRansome dataset. The UGRansome dataset is designed for anomaly detection research and includes both normal and abnormal network threat categories of zero-day attacks. A comparison is made using the Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms, while also evaluating the effectiveness of Boruta and PCA. The findings show that PCA is more promising than using Boruta alone for extracting cyclostationary network feature patterns. Additionally, the analysis identifies the internet protocol as the most noticeable cyclostationary feature pattern used by malware. Notably, the UGRansome dataset outperforms the KDD99 and NSL-KDD, achieving 99% accuracy in signature malware detection using the RF algorithm and 98% with the SVM.

> Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) is increasing the scale and complexity of ransomware attacks. Understanding the internal operations behind RaaS has been a challenge due to the illegality of such activities. The recent chat leak of the Conti RaaS operator, one of the most infamous ransomware operators on the international scene, offers a key opportunity to better understand the inner workings of such organizations. This paper analyzes the main topic discussions in the Conti chat leak using machine learning techniques such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), as well as visualization strategies. Five discussion topics are found: 1) Business, 2) Technical, 3) Internal tasking/Management, 4) Malware, and 5) Customer Service/Problem Solving. Moreover, the distribution of topics among Conti members shows that only 4% of individuals have specialized discussions while almost all individuals (96%) are all-rounders, meaning that their discussions revolve around the five topics. The results also indicate that a significant proportion of Conti discussions are non-tech related. This study thus highlights that running such large RaaS operations requires a workforce skilled beyond technical abilities, with individuals involved in various tasks, from management to customer service or problem solving. The discussion topics also show that the organization behind the Conti RaaS oper5086933ator shares similarities with a large firm. We conclude that, although RaaS represents an example of specialization in the cybercrime industry, only a few members are specialized in one topic, while the rest runs and coordinates the RaaS operation.

> Due to the proliferation of malware, defenders are increasingly turning to automation and machine learning as part of the malware detection tool-chain. However, machine learning models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, requiring the testing of model and product robustness. Meanwhile, attackers also seek to automate malware generation and evasion of antivirus systems, and defenders try to gain insight into their methods. This work proposes a new algorithm that combines Malware Evasion and Model Extraction (MEME) attacks. MEME uses model-based reinforcement learning to adversarially modify Windows executable binary samples while simultaneously training a surrogate model with a high agreement with the target model to evade. To evaluate this method, we compare it with two state-of-the-art attacks in adversarial malware creation, using three well-known published models and one antivirus product as targets. Results show that MEME outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of evasion capabilities in almost all cases, producing evasive malware with an evasion rate in the range of 32-73%. It also produces surrogate models with a prediction label agreement with the respective target models between 97-99%. The surrogate could be used to fine-tune and improve the evasion rate in the future.

> Mobile devices have widespread to become the most used piece of technology. Due to their characteristics, they have become major targets for botnet-related malware. FluBot is one example of botnet malware that infects mobile devices. In particular, FluBot is a DNS-based botnet that uses Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA) to establish communication with the Command and Control Server (C2). MONDEO is a multistage mechanism with a flexible design to detect DNS-based botnet malware. MONDEO is lightweight and can be deployed without requiring the deployment of software, agents, or configuration in mobile devices, allowing easy integration in core networks. MONDEO comprises four detection stages: Blacklisting/Whitelisting, Query rate analysis, DGA analysis, and Machine learning evaluation. It was created with the goal of processing streams of packets to identify attacks with high efficiency, in the distinct phases. MONDEO was tested against several datasets to measure its efficiency and performance, being able to achieve high performance with RandomForest classifiers. The implementation is available at github.

> We consider the problem of program clone search, i.e. given a target program and a repository of known programs (all in executable format), the goal is to find the program in the repository most similar to the target program - with potential applications in terms of reverse engineering, program clustering, malware lineage and software theft detection. Recent years have witnessed a blooming in code similarity techniques, yet most of them focus on function-level similarity and function clone search, while we are interested in program-level similarity and program clone search. Actually, our study shows that prior similarity approaches are either too slow to handle large program repositories, or not precise enough, or yet not robust against slight variations introduced by compilers, source code versions or light obfuscations. We propose a novel spectral analysis method for program-level similarity and program clone search called Programs Spectral Similarity (PSS). In a nutshell, PSS one-time spectral feature extraction is tailored for large repositories, making it a perfect fit for program clone search. We have compared the different approaches with extensive benchmarks, showing that PSS reaches a sweet spot in terms of precision, speed and robustness.

> Malware is one of the most dangerous and costly cyber threats to national security and a crucial factor in modern cyber-space. However, the adoption of machine learning (ML) based solutions against malware threats has been relatively slow. Shortcomings in the existing ML approaches are likely contributing to this problem. The majority of current ML approaches ignore real-world challenges such as the detection of novel malware. In addition, proposed ML approaches are often designed either for malware/benign-ware classification or malware family classification. Here we introduce and showcase preliminary capabilities of a new method that can perform precise identification of novel malware families, while also unifying the capability for malware/benign-ware classification and malware family classification into a single framework.

> This paper of work examines the SolarWinds attack, designed on Orion Platform security incident. It analyses the persistent threats agents and potential technical attack techniques to gain unauthorized access. In 2020 SolarWinds attack indicates an initial breach disclosure on Orion Platform software by malware distribution on IT and government organizations such as Homeland Security, Microsoft and Intel associated with supply chains leaks consequences from small loopholes in security systems. Hackers increased the number of infected company and businesses networks during the supply-chain attack, hackers were capable to propagate the attack by using a VMware exploit. On the special way they started to target command injections, privilege escalations, and use after free platforms of VMware. In this way, they gained access to Virtual Machines and in the east way pivot other servers. This literature review aim to analyze the security gap regarding to SolarWinds incident on Orion Platform, the impact on industry and financial sectors involving the elements of incident response plan. Therefore, this research paper ensures specifications of proper solutions for possible defense security systems by analyzing a SolarWinds attack case study via system evaluation and monitoring. It concludes with necessary remediation actions on cyber hygiene countermeasures, common vulnerabilities and exposure analysis and solutions.

> The widespread adoption of the Android operating system has made malicious Android applications an appealing target for attackers. Machine learning-based (ML-based) Android malware detection (AMD) methods are crucial in addressing this problem; however, their vulnerability to adversarial examples raises concerns. Current attacks against ML-based AMD methods demonstrate remarkable performance but rely on strong assumptions that may not be realistic in real-world scenarios, e.g., the knowledge requirements about feature space, model parameters, and training dataset. To address this limitation, we introduce AdvDroidZero, an efficient query-based attack framework against ML-based AMD methods that operates under the zero knowledge setting. Our extensive evaluation shows that AdvDroidZero is effective against various mainstream ML-based AMD methods, in particular, state-of-the-art such methods and real-world antivirus solutions.

> Breached data refers to the unauthorized access, theft, or exposure of confidential or sensitive information. Breaches typically occur when malicious actors or unauthorized users breach secure systems or networks, resulting in compromised personally identifiable information (PII), protected or personal health information (PHI), payment card industry (PCI) information, or other sensitive data. Data breaches are often the result of malicious activities such as hacking, phishing, insider threats, malware, or physical theft. The misuse of breached data can lead to identity theft, fraud, spamming, or blackmailing. Organizations that experience data breaches may face legal and financial consequences, reputational damage, and harm to their customers or users. Breached records are commonly sold on the dark web or made available on various public forums. To counteract these malicious activities, it is possible to collect breached databases and mitigate potential harm. These databases can be quite large, reaching sizes of up to 150 GB or more. Typically, breached data is stored in the CSV (Comma Separated Value) format due to its simplicity and lightweight nature, which reduces storage requirements. Analyzing and traversing large breached databases necessitates substantial computational power. However, this research explores techniques to optimize database traversal speed without the need to rent expensive cloud machines or virtual private servers (VPS). This optimization will enable individual security researchers to analyze and process large databases on their personal computer systems while significantly reducing costs.

> Similar to the revolution of open source code sharing, Artificial Intelligence (AI) model sharing is gaining increased popularity. However, the fast adaptation in the industry, lack of awareness, and ability to exploit the models make them significant attack vectors. By embedding malware in neurons, the malware can be delivered covertly, with minor or no impact on the neural network's performance. The covert attack will use the Least Significant Bits (LSB) weight attack since LSB has a minimal effect on the model accuracy, and as a result, the user will not notice it. Since there are endless ways to hide the attacks, we focus on a zero-trust prevention strategy based on AI model attack disarm and reconstruction. We proposed three types of model steganography weight disarm defense mechanisms. The first two are based on random bit substitution noise, and the other on model weight quantization. We demonstrate a 100\% prevention rate while the methods introduce a minimal decrease in model accuracy based on Qint8 and K-LRBP methods, which is an essential factor for improving AI security.

> Today, malware is one of the primary cyberthreats to organizations. Malware has pervaded almost every type of computing device including the ones having limited memory, battery and computation power such as mobile phones, tablets and embedded devices like Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Consequently, the privacy and security of the malware infected systems and devices have been heavily jeopardized. In recent years, researchers have leveraged machine learning based strategies for malware detection and classification. Malware analysis approaches can only be employed in resource constrained environments if the methods are lightweight in nature. In this paper, we present MALITE, a lightweight malware analysis system, that can classify various malware families and distinguish between benign and malicious binaries. MALITE converts a binary into a gray scale or an RGB image and employs low memory and battery power consuming as well as computationally inexpensive malware analysis strategies. We have designed MALITE-MN, a lightweight neural network based architecture and MALITE-HRF, an ultra lightweight random forest based method that uses histogram features extracted by a sliding window. We evaluate the performance of both on six publicly available datasets (Malimg, Microsoft BIG, Dumpware10, MOTIF, Drebin and CICAndMal2017), and compare them to four state-of-the-art malware classification techniques. The results show that MALITE-MN and MALITE-HRF not only accurately identify and classify malware but also respectively consume several orders of magnitude lower resources (in terms of both memory as well as computation capabilities), making them much more suitable for resource constrained environments.

> The evolution of Generative AI and the capabilities of the newly released Large Language Models (LLMs) open new opportunities in software engineering. However, they also lead to new challenges in cybersecurity. Recently, researchers have shown the possibilities of using LLMs such as ChatGPT to generate malicious content that can directly be exploited or guide inexperienced hackers to weaponize tools and code. These studies covered scenarios that still require the attacker to be in the middle of the loop. In this study, we leverage openly available plugins and use an LLM as proxy between the attacker and the victim. We deliver a proof-of-concept where ChatGPT is used for the dissemination of malicious software while evading detection, alongside establishing the communication to a command and control (C2) server to receive commands to interact with a victim's system. Finally, we present the general approach as well as essential elements in order to stay undetected and make the attack a success. This proof-of-concept highlights significant cybersecurity issues with openly available plugins and LLMs, which require the development of security guidelines, controls, and mitigation strategies.

- *Xiaochun Yun, Jiang Xie, Shuhao Li, Yongzheng Zhang, Peishuai Sun*

- `2309.03739v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03739v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.03739v1)

> Malicious communication behavior is the network communication behavior generated by malware (bot-net, spyware, etc.) after victim devices are infected. Experienced adversaries often hide malicious information in HTTP traffic to evade detection. However, related detection methods have inadequate generalization ability because they are usually based on artificial feature engineering and outmoded datasets. In this paper, we propose an HTTP-based Malicious Communication traffic Detection Model (HMCD-Model) based on generated adversarial flows and hierarchical traffic features. HMCD-Model consists of two parts. The first is a generation algorithm based on WGAN-GP to generate HTTP-based malicious communication traffic for data enhancement. The second is a hybrid neural network based on CNN and LSTM to extract hierarchical spatial-temporal features of traffic. In addition, we collect and publish a dataset, HMCT-2020, which consists of large-scale malicious and benign traffic during three years (2018-2020). Taking the data in HMCT-2020(18) as the training set and the data in other datasets as the test set, the experimental results show that the HMCD-Model can effectively detect unknown HTTP-based malicious communication traffic. It can reach F1 = 98.66% in the dataset HMCT-2020(19-20), F1 = 90.69% in the public dataset CIC-IDS-2017, and F1 = 83.66% in the real traffic, which is 20+% higher than other representative methods on average. This validates that HMCD-Model has the ability to discover unknown HTTP-based malicious communication behavior.

> We introduce the $ARMOR_D$ methods as novel approaches to enhancing the adversarial robustness of deep learning models. These methods are based on a new class of optimal-transport-regularized divergences, constructed via an infimal convolution between an information divergence and an optimal-transport (OT) cost. We use these as tools to enhance adversarial robustness by maximizing the expected loss over a neighborhood of distributions, a technique known as distributionally robust optimization. Viewed as a tool for constructing adversarial samples, our method allows samples to be both transported, according to the OT cost, and re-weighted, according to the information divergence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on malware detection and image recognition applications and find that, to our knowledge, it outperforms existing methods at enhancing the robustness against adversarial attacks. $ARMOR_D$ yields the robustified accuracy of $98.29\%$ against $FGSM$ and $98.18\%$ against $PGD^{40}$ on the MNIST dataset, reducing the error rate by more than $19.7\%$ and $37.2\%$ respectively compared to prior methods. Similarly, in malware detection, a discrete (binary) data domain, $ARMOR_D$ improves the robustified accuracy under $rFGSM^{50}$ attack compared to the previous best-performing adversarial training methods by $37.0\%$ while lowering false negative and false positive rates by $51.1\%$ and $57.53\%$, respectively.

> Malware authors often use cryptographic tools such as XOR encryption and block ciphers like AES to obfuscate part of the malware to evade detection. Use of cryptography may give the impression that these obfuscation techniques have some provable guarantees of success. In this paper, we take a closer look at the use of cryptographic tools to obfuscate malware. We first find that most techniques are easy to defeat (in principle), since the decryption algorithm and the key is shipped within the program. In order to clearly define an obfuscation technique's potential to evade detection we propose a principled definition of malware obfuscation, and then categorize instances of malware obfuscation that use cryptographic tools into those which evade detection and those which are detectable. We find that schemes that are hard to de-obfuscate necessarily rely on a construct based on environmental keying. We also show that cryptographic notions of obfuscation, e.g., indistinghuishability and virtual black box obfuscation, may not guarantee evasion detection under our model. However, they can be used in conjunction with environmental keying to produce hard to de-obfuscate version of programs.

> Recent research has shown that the integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Moving Target Defense (MTD) can enhance cybersecurity in Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Nevertheless, the practicality of existing work is hindered by data privacy concerns associated with centralized data processing in RL, and the unsatisfactory time needed to learn right MTD techniques that are effective against a rising number of heterogeneous zero-day attacks. Thus, this work presents CyberForce, a framework that combines Federated and Reinforcement Learning (FRL) to collaboratively and privately learn suitable MTD techniques for mitigating zero-day attacks. CyberForce integrates device fingerprinting and anomaly detection to reward or penalize MTD mechanisms chosen by an FRL-based agent. The framework has been deployed and evaluated in a scenario consisting of ten physical devices of a real IoT platform affected by heterogeneous malware samples. A pool of experiments has demonstrated that CyberForce learns the MTD technique mitigating each attack faster than existing RL-based centralized approaches. In addition, when various devices are exposed to different attacks, CyberForce benefits from knowledge transfer, leading to enhanced performance and reduced learning time in comparison to recent works. Finally, different aggregation algorithms used during the agent learning process provide CyberForce with notable robustness to malicious attacks.

> Neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor poisoning attacks, where the attackers maliciously poison the training set and insert triggers into the test input to change the prediction of the victim model. Existing defenses for backdoor attacks either provide no formal guarantees or come with expensive-to-compute and ineffective probabilistic guarantees. We present PECAN, an efficient and certified approach for defending against backdoor attacks. The key insight powering PECAN is to apply off-the-shelf test-time evasion certification techniques on a set of neural networks trained on disjoint partitions of the data. We evaluate PECAN on image classification and malware detection datasets. Our results demonstrate that PECAN can (1) significantly outperform the state-of-the-art certified backdoor defense, both in defense strength and efficiency, and (2) on real back-door attacks, PECAN can reduce attack success rate by order of magnitude when compared to a range of baselines from the literature.

> Machine learning (ML) is promising in accurately detecting malicious flows in encrypted network traffic; however, it is challenging to collect a training dataset that contains a sufficient amount of encrypted malicious data with correct labels. When ML models are trained with low-quality training data, they suffer degraded performance. In this paper, we aim at addressing a real-world low-quality training dataset problem, namely, detecting encrypted malicious traffic generated by continuously evolving malware. We develop RAPIER that fully utilizes different distributions of normal and malicious traffic data in the feature space, where normal data is tightly distributed in a certain area and the malicious data is scattered over the entire feature space to augment training data for model training. RAPIER includes two pre-processing modules to convert traffic into feature vectors and correct label noises. We evaluate our system on two public datasets and one combined dataset. With 1000 samples and 45% noises from each dataset, our system achieves the F1 scores of 0.770, 0.776, and 0.855, respectively, achieving average improvements of 352.6%, 284.3%, and 214.9% over the existing methods, respectively. Furthermore, We evaluate RAPIER with a real-world dataset obtained from a security enterprise. RAPIER effectively achieves encrypted malicious traffic detection with the best F1 score of 0.773 and improves the F1 score of existing methods by an average of 272.5%.

> Identification of the family to which a malware specimen belongs is essential in understanding the behavior of the malware and developing mitigation strategies. Solutions proposed by prior work, however, are often not practicable due to the lack of realistic evaluation factors. These factors include learning under class imbalance, the ability to identify new malware, and the cost of production-quality labeled data. In practice, deployed models face prominent, rare, and new malware families. At the same time, obtaining a large quantity of up-to-date labeled malware for training a model can be expensive. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel hierarchical semi-supervised algorithm, which we call the HNMFk Classifier, that can be used in the early stages of the malware family labeling process. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization with automatic model selection, that is, with an estimation of the number of clusters. With HNMFk Classifier, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the malware data together with a semi-supervised setup, which enables us to classify malware families under conditions of extreme class imbalance. Our solution can perform abstaining predictions, or rejection option, which yields promising results in the identification of novel malware families and helps with maintaining the performance of the model when a low quantity of labeled data is used. We perform bulk classification of nearly 2,900 both rare and prominent malware families, through static analysis, using nearly 388,000 samples from the EMBER-2018 corpus. In our experiments, we surpass both supervised and semi-supervised baseline models with an F1 score of 0.80.

> Hardware-based Malware Detectors (HMDs) have shown promise in detecting malicious workloads. However, the current HMDs focus solely on the CPU core of a System-on-Chip (SoC) and, therefore, do not exploit the full potential of the hardware telemetry. In this paper, we propose XMD, an HMD that uses an expansive set of telemetry channels extracted from the different subsystems of SoC. XMD exploits the thread-level profiling power of the CPU-core telemetry, and the global profiling power of non-core telemetry channels, to achieve significantly better detection performance than currently used Hardware Performance Counter (HPC) based detectors. We leverage the concept of manifold hypothesis to analytically prove that adding non-core telemetry channels improves the separability of the benign and malware classes, resulting in performance gains. We train and evaluate XMD using hardware telemetries collected from 723 benign applications and 1033 malware samples on a commodity Android Operating System (OS)-based mobile device. XMD improves over currently used HPC-based detectors by 32.91% for the in-distribution test data. XMD achieves the best detection performance of 86.54% with a false positive rate of 2.9%, compared to the detection rate of 80%, offered by the best performing signature-based Anti-Virus(AV) on VirusTotal, on the same set of malware samples.

> Software debloating techniques are applied to craft a specialized version of the program based on the user's requirements and remove irrelevant code accordingly. The debloated programs presumably maintain better performance and reduce the attack surface in contrast to the original programs. This work unleashes the effectiveness of applying software debloating techniques on the robustness of machine learning systems in the malware classification domain. We empirically study how an adversarial can leverage software debloating techniques to mislead machine learning malware classification models. We apply software debloating techniques to generate adversarial examples and demonstrate these adversarial examples can reduce the detection rate of VirusTotal. Our study opens new directions for research into adversarial machine learning not only in malware detection/classification but also in other software domains.

> The rapidly evolving nature of Android apps poses a significant challenge to static batch machine learning algorithms employed in malware detection systems, as they quickly become obsolete. Despite this challenge, the existing literature pays limited attention to addressing this issue, with many advanced Android malware detection approaches, such as Drebin, DroidDet and MaMaDroid, relying on static models. In this work, we show how retraining techniques are able to maintain detector capabilities over time. Particularly, we analyze the effect of two aspects in the efficiency and performance of the detectors: 1) the frequency with which the models are retrained, and 2) the data used for retraining. In the first experiment, we compare periodic retraining with a more advanced concept drift detection method that triggers retraining only when necessary. In the second experiment, we analyze sampling methods to reduce the amount of data used to retrain models. Specifically, we compare fixed sized windows of recent data and state-of-the-art active learning methods that select those apps that help keep the training dataset small but diverse. Our experiments show that concept drift detection and sample selection mechanisms result in very efficient retraining strategies which can be successfully used to maintain the performance of the static Android malware state-of-the-art detectors in changing environments.

> Embedded, smart, and IoT devices are increasingly popular in numerous everyday settings. Since lower-end devices have the most strict cost constraints, they tend to have few, if any, security features. This makes them attractive targets for exploits and malware. Prior research proposed various security architectures for enforcing security properties for resource-constrained devices, e.g., via Remote Attestation (RA). Such techniques can (statically) verify software integrity of a remote device and detect compromise. However, run-time (dynamic) security, e.g., via Control-Flow Integrity (CFI), is hard to achieve. This work constructs an architecture that ensures integrity of software execution against run-time attacks, such as Return-Oriented Programming (ROP). It is built atop a recently proposed CASU -- a low-cost active Root-of-Trust (RoT) that guarantees software immutability. We extend CASU to support a shadow stack and a CFI monitor to mitigate run-time attacks. This gives some confidence that CFI can indeed be attained even on low-end devices, with minimal hardware overhead.

> Dynamic analysis enables detecting Windows malware by executing programs in a controlled environment, and storing their actions in log reports. Previous work has started training machine learning models on such reports to perform either malware detection or malware classification. However, most of the approaches (i) have only considered convolutional and long-short term memory networks, (ii) they have been built focusing only on APIs called at runtime, without considering other relevant though heterogeneous sources of information like network and file operations, and (iii) the code and pretrained models are hardly available, hindering reproducibility of results in this research area. In this work, we overcome these limitations by presenting Nebula, a versatile, self-attention transformer-based neural architecture that can generalize across different behavior representations and formats, combining heterogeneous information from dynamic log reports. We show the efficacy of Nebula on three distinct data collections from different dynamic analysis platforms, comparing its performance with previous state-of-the-art models developed for malware detection and classification tasks. We produce an extensive ablation study that showcases how the components of Nebula influence its predictive performance, while enabling it to outperform some competing approaches at very low false positive rates. We conclude our work by inspecting the behavior of Nebula through the application of explainability methods, which highlight that Nebula correctly focuses more on portions of reports that contain malicious activities. We release our code and models at github.com/dtrizna/nebula.

> Embedded, smart, and IoT devices are increasingly popular in numerous everyday settings. Since lower-end devices have the most strict cost constraints, they tend to have few, if any, security features. This makes them attractive targets for exploits and malware. Prior research proposed various security architectures for enforcing security properties for resource-constrained devices, e.g., via Remote Attestation (RA). Such techniques can (statically) verify software integrity of a remote device and detect compromise. However, run-time (dynamic) security, e.g., via Control-Flow Integrity (CFI), is hard to achieve. This work constructs an architecture that ensures integrity of software execution against run-time attacks, such as Return-Oriented Programming (ROP). It is built atop a recently proposed CASU -- a low-cost active Root-of-Trust (RoT) that guarantees software immutability. We extend CASU to support a shadow stack and a CFI monitor to mitigate run-time attacks. This gives some confidence that CFI can indeed be attained even on low-end devices, with minimal hardware overhead.

> In the very last years, cybersecurity attacks have increased at an unprecedented pace, becoming ever more sophisticated and costly. Their impact has involved both private/public companies and critical infrastructures. At the same time, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the security perimeters of many organizations expanded, causing an increase of the attack surface exploitable by threat actors through malware and phishing attacks. Given these factors, it is of primary importance to monitor the security perimeter and the events occurring in the monitored network, according to a tested security strategy of detection and response. In this paper, we present a protocol tunneling detector prototype which inspects, in near real time, a company's network traffic using machine learning techniques. Indeed, tunneling attacks allow malicious actors to maximize the time in which their activity remains undetected. The detector monitors unencrypted network flows and extracts features to detect possible occurring attacks and anomalies, by combining machine learning and deep learning. The proposed module can be embedded in any network security monitoring platform able to provide network flow information along with its metadata. The detection capabilities of the implemented prototype have been tested both on benign and malicious datasets. Results show 97.1% overall accuracy and an F1-score equals to 95.6%.

> Steganography, or hiding messages in plain sight, is a form of information hiding that is most commonly used for covert communication. As modern steganographic mediums include images, text, audio, and video, this communication method is being increasingly used by bad actors to propagate malware, exfiltrate data, and discreetly communicate. Current protection mechanisms rely upon steganalysis, or the detection of steganography, but these approaches are dependent upon prior knowledge, such as steganographic signatures from publicly available tools and statistical knowledge about known hiding methods. These dependencies render steganalysis useless against new or unique hiding methods, which are becoming increasingly common with the application of deep learning models. To mitigate the shortcomings of steganalysis, this work focuses on a deep learning sanitization technique called SUDS that is not reliant upon knowledge of steganographic hiding techniques and is able to sanitize universal and dependent steganography. SUDS is tested using least significant bit method (LSB), dependent deep hiding (DDH), and universal deep hiding (UDH). We demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of SUDS by answering five research questions, including baseline comparisons and an ablation study. Additionally, we apply SUDS to a real-world scenario, where it is able to increase the resistance of a poisoned classifier against attacks by 1375%.

> Cybersecurity has become a significant issue in the digital era as a result of the growth in everyday computer use. Cybercriminals now engage in more than virus distribution and computer hacking. Cyberwarfare has developed as a result because it has become a threat to a nation's survival. Malware analysis serves as the first line of defence against an attack and is a significant component of cybercrime. Every day, malware attacks target a large number of computer users, businesses, and governmental agencies, causing billions of dollars in losses. Malware may evade multiple AV software with a very minor, cunning tweak made by its designers, despite the fact that security experts have a variety of tools at their disposal to identify it. To address this challenge, a new dataset called the Obfuscated Malware Dataset (OMD) has been developed. This dataset comprises 40 distinct malware families having 21924 samples, and it incorporates obfuscation techniques that mimic the strategies employed by malware creators to make their malware variations different from the original samples. The purpose of this dataset is to provide a more realistic and representative environment for evaluating the effectiveness of malware analysis techniques. Different conventional machine learning algorithms including but not limited to Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forrest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST) etc are applied and contrasted. The results demonstrated that XGBoost outperformed the other algorithms, achieving an accuracy of f 82%, precision of 88%, recall of 80%, and an F1-Score of 83%.

> Recently, there has been a growing focus and interest in applying machine learning (ML) to the field of cybersecurity, particularly in malware detection and prevention. Several research works on malware analysis have been proposed, offering promising results for both academic and practical applications. In these works, the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Reinforcement Learning (RL) can aid malware creators in crafting metamorphic malware that evades antivirus software. In this study, we propose a mutation system to counteract ensemble learning-based detectors by combining GANs and an RL model, overcoming the limitations of the MalGAN model. Our proposed FeaGAN model is built based on MalGAN by incorporating an RL model called the Deep Q-network anti-malware Engines Attacking Framework (DQEAF). The RL model addresses three key challenges in performing adversarial attacks on Windows Portable Executable malware, including format preservation, executability preservation, and maliciousness preservation. In the FeaGAN model, ensemble learning is utilized to enhance the malware detector's evasion ability, with the generated adversarial patterns. The experimental results demonstrate that 100\% of the selected mutant samples preserve the format of executable files, while certain successes in both executability preservation and maliciousness preservation are achieved, reaching a stable success rate.

> Past Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks on Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT), such as the 2016 Ukrainian power grid attack and the 2017 Saudi petrochemical plant attack, have shown the disruptive effects of APT campaigns while new IIoT malware continue to be developed by APT groups. Existing APT detection systems have been designed using cyberattack TTPs modelled for enterprise IT networks and leverage specific data sources (e.g., Linux audit logs, Windows event logs) which are not found on ICS devices. In this work, we propose RAPTOR, a system to detect APT campaigns in IIoT. Using cyberattack TTPs modelled for ICS/OT environments and focusing on "invariant" attack phases, RAPTOR detects and correlates various APT attack stages in IIoT leveraging data which can be readily collected from ICS devices/networks (packet traffic traces, IDS alerts). Subsequently, it constructs a high-level APT campaign graph which can be used by cybersecurity analysts towards attack analysis and mitigation. A performance evaluation of RAPTOR's APT attack-stage detection modules shows high precision and low false positive/negative rates. We also show that RAPTOR is able to construct the APT campaign graph for APT attacks (modelled after real-world attacks on ICS/OT infrastructure) executed on our IIoT testbed.

> Similar to the revolution of open source code sharing, Artificial Intelligence (AI) model sharing is gaining increased popularity. However, the fast adaptation in the industry, lack of awareness, and ability to exploit the models make them significant attack vectors. By embedding malware in neurons, the malware can be delivered covertly, with minor or no impact on the neural network's performance. The covert attack will use the Least Significant Bits (LSB) weight attack since LSB has a minimal effect on the model accuracy, and as a result, the user will not notice it. Since there are endless ways to hide the attacks, we focus on a zero-trust prevention strategy based on AI model attack disarm and reconstruction. We proposed three types of model steganography weight disarm defense mechanisms. The first two are based on random bit substitution noise, and the other on model weight quantization. We demonstrate a 100\% prevention rate while the methods introduce a minimal decrease in model accuracy based on Qint8 and K-LRBP methods, which is an essential factor for improving AI security.

> RISC-V is an emerging technology, with applications ranging from embedded devices to high-performance servers. Therefore, more and more security-critical workloads will be conducted with code that is compiled for RISC-V. Well-known microarchitectural side-channel attacks against established platforms like x86 apply to RISC-V CPUs as well. As RISC-V does not mandate any hardware-based side-channel countermeasures, a piece of code compiled for a generic RISC-V CPU in a cloud server cannot make safe assumptions about the microarchitecture on which it is running. Existing tools for aiding software-level precautions by checking side-channel vulnerabilities on source code or x86 binaries are not compatible with RISC-V machine code.   In this work, we study the requirements and goals of architecture-specific leakage analysis for RISC-V and illustrate how to achieve these goals with the help of fast and precise dynamic binary analysis. We implement all necessary building blocks for finding side-channel leakages on RISC-V, while relying on existing mature solutions when possible. Our leakage analysis builds upon the modular side-channel analysis framework Microwalk, that examines execution traces for leakage through secret-dependent memory accesses or branches. To provide suitable traces, we port the ARM dynamic binary instrumentation tool MAMBO to RISC-V. Our port named MAMBO-V can instrument arbitrary binaries which use the 64-bit general purpose instruction set. We evaluate our toolchain on several cryptographic libraries with RISC-V support and identify multiple exploitable leakages.

> Moving Target Defense and Cyber Deception emerged in recent years as two key proactive cyber defense approaches, contrasting with the static nature of the traditional reactive cyber defense. The key insight behind these approaches is to impose an asymmetric disadvantage for the attacker by using deception and randomization techniques to create a dynamic attack surface. Moving Target Defense typically relies on system randomization and diversification, while Cyber Deception is based on decoy nodes and fake systems to deceive attackers. However, current Moving Target Defense techniques are complex to manage and can introduce high overheads, while Cyber Deception nodes are easily recognized and avoided by adversaries. This paper presents DOLOS, a novel architecture that unifies Cyber Deception and Moving Target Defense approaches. DOLOS is motivated by the insight that deceptive techniques are much more powerful when integrated into production systems rather than deployed alongside them. DOLOS combines typical Moving Target Defense techniques, such as randomization, diversity, and redundancy, with cyber deception and seamlessly integrates them into production systems through multiple layers of isolation. We extensively evaluate DOLOS against a wide range of attackers, ranging from automated malware to professional penetration testers, and show that DOLOS is highly effective in slowing down attacks and protecting the integrity of production systems. We also provide valuable insights and considerations for the future development of MTD techniques based on our findings.

> The increasing popularity of certain programming languages has spurred the creation of ecosystem-specific package repositories and package managers. Such repositories (e.g., NPM, PyPI) serve as public databases that users can query to retrieve packages for various functionalities, whereas package managers automatically handle dependency resolution and package installation on the client side. These mechanisms enhance software modularization and accelerate implementation. However, they have become a target for malicious actors seeking to propagate malware on a large scale.   In this work, we show how attackers can leverage capabilities of popular package managers and languages to achieve arbitrary code execution on victim machines, thereby realizing open-source software supply chain attacks. Based on the analysis of 7 ecosystems, we identify 3 install-time and 4 runtime techniques, and we provide recommendations describing how to reduce the risk when consuming third-party dependencies. We will provide proof-of-concepts that demonstrate the identified techniques. Furthermore, we describe evasion strategies employed by attackers to circumvent detection mechanisms.

> Malware poses a significant security risk to individuals, organizations, and critical infrastructure by compromising systems and data. Leveraging memory dumps that offer snapshots of computer memory can aid the analysis and detection of malicious content, including malware. To improve the efficacy and address privacy concerns in malware classification systems, feature selection can play a critical role as it is capable of identifying the most relevant features, thus, minimizing the amount of data fed to classifiers. In this study, we employ three feature selection approaches to identify significant features from memory content and use them with a diverse set of classifiers to enhance the performance and privacy of the classification task. Comprehensive experiments are conducted across three levels of malware classification tasks: i) binary-level benign or malware classification, ii) malware type classification (including Trojan horse, ransomware, and spyware), and iii) malware family classification within each family (with varying numbers of classes). Results demonstrate that the feature selection strategy, incorporating mutual information and other methods, enhances classifier performance for all tasks. Notably, selecting only 25\% and 50\% of input features using Mutual Information and then employing the Random Forest classifier yields the best results. Our findings reinforce the importance of feature selection for malware classification and provide valuable insights for identifying appropriate approaches. By advancing the effectiveness and privacy of malware classification systems, this research contributes to safeguarding against security threats posed by malicious software.

This paper investigates the targeting of journalists and activists by the malware Pegasus. To gain a deeper understanding of the tactics utilized by cybercriminals and the vulnerabilities that facilitate their scope, this research looks on numerous occurrences and identifies recurring patterns in the strategies, methods, and practices employed. In this paper, a comprehensive analysis is conducted on the far-reaching consequences of these attacks for cybersecurity policy, encompassing the pressing need for enhanced threat intelligence sharing mechanisms, the implementation of more resilient incident response protocols, and the allocation of greater financial resources towards the advancement of cybersecurity research and development initiatives. The research also discusses how Pegasus will affect SCADA systems and critical infrastructure, and it describes some of the most important tactics that businesses may use to reduce the danger of cyberattacks and safeguard themselves against the 21st century's growing threats.

> Machine Learning (ML) models have been utilized for malware detection for over two decades. Consequently, this ignited an ongoing arms race between malware authors and antivirus systems, compelling researchers to propose defenses for malware-detection models against evasion attacks. However, most if not all existing defenses against evasion attacks suffer from sizable performance degradation and/or can defend against only specific attacks, which makes them less practical in real-world settings. In this work, we develop a certified defense, DRSM (De-Randomized Smoothed MalConv), by redesigning the de-randomized smoothing technique for the domain of malware detection. Specifically, we propose a window ablation scheme to provably limit the impact of adversarial bytes while maximally preserving local structures of the executables. After showing how DRSM is theoretically robust against attacks with contiguous adversarial bytes, we verify its performance and certified robustness experimentally, where we observe only marginal accuracy drops as the cost of robustness. To our knowledge, we are the first to offer certified robustness in the realm of static detection of malware executables. More surprisingly, through evaluating DRSM against 9 empirical attacks of different types, we observe that the proposed defense is empirically robust to some extent against a diverse set of attacks, some of which even fall out of the scope of its original threat model. In addition, we collected 15.5K recent benign raw executables from diverse sources, which will be made public as a dataset called PACE (Publicly Accessible Collection(s) of Executables) to alleviate the scarcity of publicly available benign datasets for studying malware detection and provide future research with more representative data of the time.

> In recent years there has been a shift from heuristics-based malware detection towards machine learning, which proves to be more robust in the current heavily adversarial threat landscape. While we acknowledge machine learning to be better equipped to mine for patterns in the increasingly high amounts of similar-looking files, we also note a remarkable scarcity of the data available for similarity-targeted research. Moreover, we observe that the focus in the few related works falls on quantifying similarity in malware, often overlooking the clean data. This one-sided quantification is especially dangerous in the context of detection bypass. We propose to address the deficiencies in the space of similarity research on binary files, starting from EMBER - one of the largest malware classification data sets. We enhance EMBER with similarity information as well as malware class tags, to enable further research in the similarity space. Our contribution is threefold: (1) we publish EMBERSim, an augmented version of EMBER, that includes similarity-informed tags; (2) we enrich EMBERSim with automatically determined malware class tags using the open-source tool AVClass on VirusTotal data and (3) we describe and share the implementation for our class scoring technique and leaf similarity method.

> Cybersecurity is a major concern due to the increasing reliance on technology and interconnected systems. Malware detectors help mitigate cyber-attacks by comparing malware signatures. Machine learning can improve these detectors by automating feature extraction, identifying patterns, and enhancing dynamic analysis. In this paper, the performance of six multiclass classification models is compared on the Malimg dataset, Blended dataset, and Malevis dataset to gain insights into the effect of class imbalance on model performance and convergence. It is observed that the more the class imbalance less the number of epochs required for convergence and a high variance across the performance of different models. Moreover, it is also observed that for malware detectors ResNet50, EfficientNetB0, and DenseNet169 can handle imbalanced and balanced data well. A maximum precision of 97% is obtained for the imbalanced dataset, a maximum precision of 95% is obtained on the intermediate imbalance dataset, and a maximum precision of 95% is obtained for the perfectly balanced dataset.

> Clickbait PDFs are PDF documents that do not embed malware but trick victims into visiting malicious web pages leading to attacks like password theft or drive-by download. While recent reports indicate a surge of clickbait PDFs, prior works have largely neglected this new threat, considering PDFs only as accessories of email phishing campaigns.   This paper investigates the landscape of clickbait PDFs and presents the first systematic and comprehensive study of this phenomenon. Starting from a real-world dataset, we identify 44 clickbait PDF clusters via clustering and characterize them by looking at their volumetric, temporal, and visual features. Among these, we identify three large clusters covering 89% of the dataset, exhibiting significantly different volumetric and temporal properties compared to classical email phishing, and relying on web UI elements as visual baits. Finally, we look at the distribution vectors and show that clickbait PDFs are not only distributed via attachments but also via Search Engine Optimization attacks, placing clickbait PDFs outside the email distribution ecosystem.   Clickbait PDFs seem to be a lurking threat, not subjected to any form of content-based filtering or detection: AV scoring systems, like VirusTotal, rank them considerably low, creating a blind spot for organizations. While URL blocklists can help to prevent victims from visiting the attack web pages, we observe that they have a limited coverage.

> Toward robust malware detection, we explore the attack surface of existing malware detection systems. We conduct root-cause analyses of the practical binary-level black-box adversarial malware examples. Additionally, we uncover the sensitivity of volatile features within the detection engines and exhibit their exploitability. Highlighting volatile information channels within the software, we introduce three software pre-processing steps to eliminate the attack surface, namely, padding removal, software stripping, and inter-section information resetting. Further, to counter the emerging section injection attacks, we propose a graph-based section-dependent information extraction scheme for software representation. The proposed scheme leverages aggregated information within various sections in the software to enable robust malware detection and mitigate adversarial settings. Our experimental results show that traditional malware detection models are ineffective against adversarial threats. However, the attack surface can be largely reduced by eliminating the volatile information. Therefore, we propose simple-yet-effective methods to mitigate the impacts of binary manipulation attacks. Overall, our graph-based malware detection scheme can accurately detect malware with an area under the curve score of 88.32\% and a score of 88.19% under a combination of binary manipulation attacks, exhibiting the efficiency of our proposed scheme.

> Being able to identify functions of interest in cross-architecture software is useful whether you are analysing for malware, securing the software supply chain or conducting vulnerability research. Cross-Architecture Binary Code Similarity Search has been explored in numerous studies and has used a wide range of different data sources to achieve its goals. The data sources typically used draw on common structures derived from binaries such as function control flow graphs or binary level call graphs, the output of the disassembly process or the outputs of a dynamic analysis approach. One data source which has received less attention is binary intermediate representations. Binary Intermediate representations possess two interesting properties: they are cross architecture by their very nature and encode the semantics of a function explicitly to support downstream usage. Within this paper we propose Function as a String Encoded Representation (FASER) which combines long document transformers with the use of intermediate representations to create a model capable of cross architecture function search without the need for manual feature engineering, pre-training or a dynamic analysis step. We compare our approach against a series of baseline approaches for two tasks; A general function search task and a targeted vulnerability search task. Our approach demonstrates strong performance across both tasks, performing better than all baseline approaches.

In this study, we employ three feature selection approaches to identify significant features from memory content and use them with a diverse set of classifiers to enhance the performance and privacy of the classification task. Comprehensive experiments are conducted across three levels of malware classification tasks: i) binary-level benign or malware classification, ii) malware type classification (including Trojan horse, ransomware, and spyware), and iii) malware family classification within each family (with varying numbers of classes). Results demonstrate that the feature selection strategy, incorporating mutual information and other methods, enhances classifier performance for all tasks. Notably, selecting only 25\% and 50\% of input features using Mutual Information and then employing the Random Forest classifier yields the best results. Our findings reinforce the importance of feature selection for malware classification and provide valuable insights for identifying appropriate approaches. By advancing the effectiveness and privacy of malware classification systems, this research contributes to safeguarding against security threats posed by malicious software.

> The increasing popularity of certain programming languages has spurred the creation of ecosystem-specific package repositories and package managers. Such repositories (e.g., npm, PyPI) serve as public databases that users can query to retrieve packages for various functionalities, whereas package managers automatically handle dependency resolution and package installation on the client side. These mechanisms enhance software modularization and accelerate implementation. However, they have become a target for malicious actors seeking to propagate malware on a large scale.   In this work, we show how attackers can leverage capabilities of popular package managers and languages to achieve arbitrary code execution on victim machines, thereby realizing open-source software supply chain attacks. Based on the analysis of 7 ecosystems, we identify 3 install-time and 4 runtime techniques, and we provide recommendations describing how to reduce the risk when consuming third-party dependencies. We will provide proof-of-concepts that demonstrate the identified techniques. Furthermore, we describe evasion strategies employed by attackers to circumvent detection mechanisms.

> In a biometric recognition system, the matcher compares an old and a fresh template to decide if it is a match or not. Beyond the binary output (`yes' or `no'), more information is computed. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of information leakage during distance evaluation, with an emphasis on threshold-based obfuscated distance (\textit{i.e.}, Fuzzy Matcher). Leakage can occur due to a malware infection or the use of a weakly privacy-preserving matcher, exemplified by side channel attacks or partially obfuscated designs. We provide an exhaustive catalog of information leakage scenarios as well as their impacts on the security concerning data privacy. Each of the scenarios leads to generic attacks whose impacts are expressed in terms of computational costs, hence allowing the establishment of upper bounds on the security level.

> Being able to identify functions of interest in cross-architecture software is useful whether you are analysing for malware, securing the software supply chain or conducting vulnerability research. Cross-Architecture Binary Code Similarity Search has been explored in numerous studies and has used a wide range of different data sources to achieve its goals. The data sources typically used draw on common structures derived from binaries such as function control flow graphs or binary level call graphs, the output of the disassembly process or the outputs of a dynamic analysis approach. One data source which has received less attention is binary intermediate representations. Binary Intermediate representations possess two interesting properties: they are cross architecture by their very nature and encode the semantics of a function explicitly to support downstream usage. Within this paper we propose Function as a String Encoded Representation (FASER) which combines long document transformers with the use of intermediate representations to create a model capable of cross architecture function search without the need for manual feature engineering, pre-training or a dynamic analysis step. We compare our approach against a series of baseline approaches for two tasks; A general function search task and a targeted vulnerability search task. Our approach demonstrates strong performance across both tasks, performing better than all baseline approaches.

> Recent works have introduced input-convex neural networks (ICNNs) as learning models with advantageous training, inference, and generalization properties linked to their convex structure. In this paper, we propose a novel feature-convex neural network architecture as the composition of an ICNN with a Lipschitz feature map in order to achieve adversarial robustness. We consider the asymmetric binary classification setting with one "sensitive" class, and for this class we prove deterministic, closed-form, and easily-computable certified robust radii for arbitrary $\ell_p$-norms. We theoretically justify the use of these models by characterizing their decision region geometry, extending the universal approximation theorem for ICNN regression to the classification setting, and proving a lower bound on the probability that such models perfectly fit even unstructured uniformly distributed data in sufficiently high dimensions. Experiments on Malimg malware classification and subsets of MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets show that feature-convex classifiers attain state-of-the-art certified $\ell_1$-radii as well as substantial $\ell_2$- and $\ell_{\infty}$-radii while being far more computationally efficient than any competitive baseline.

> Steganography is the art of hiding information in plain sight. This form of covert communication can be used by bad actors to propagate malware, exfiltrate victim data, and communicate with other bad actors. Current image steganography defenses rely upon steganalysis, or the detection of hidden messages. These methods, however, are non-blind as they require information about known steganography techniques and are easily bypassed. Recent work has instead focused on a defense mechanism known as sanitization, which eliminates hidden information from images. In this work, we introduce a novel blind deep learning steganography sanitization method that utilizes a diffusion model framework to sanitize universal and dependent steganography (DM-SUDS), which both sanitizes and preserves image quality. We evaluate this approach against state-of-the-art deep learning sanitization frameworks and provide further detailed analysis through an ablation study. DM-SUDS outperforms previous sanitization methods and improves image preservation MSE by 71.32%, PSNR by 22.43% and SSIM by 17.30%. This is the first blind deep learning image sanitization framework to meet these image quality results.

> Numerous tools rely on automatic categorization of Android apps as part of their methodology. However, incorrect categorization can lead to inaccurate outcomes, such as a malware detector wrongly flagging a benign app as malicious. One such example is the SlideIT Free Keyboard app, which has over 500000 downloads on Google Play. Despite being a "Keyboard" app, it is often wrongly categorized alongside "Language" apps due to the app's description focusing heavily on language support, resulting in incorrect analysis outcomes, including mislabeling it as a potential malware when it is actually a benign app. Hence, there is a need to improve the categorization of Android apps to benefit all the tools relying on it. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of existing Android app categorization approaches using our new ground-truth dataset. Our evaluation demonstrates the notable superiority of approaches that utilize app descriptions over those solely relying on data extracted from the APK file, while also leaving space for potential improvement in the former category. Thus, we propose two innovative approaches that effectively outperform the performance of existing methods in both description-based and APK-based methodologies. Finally, by employing our novel description-based approach, we have successfully demonstrated that adopting a higher-performing categorization method can significantly benefit tools reliant on app categorization, leading to an improvement in their overall performance. This highlights the significance of developing advanced and efficient app categorization methodologies for improved results in software engineering tasks.

> Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are marvels of technology; celebrated for their prowess in natural language processing and multimodal content generation, they promise a transformative future. But as with all powerful tools, they come with their shadows. Picture living in a world where deepfakes are indistinguishable from reality, where synthetic identities orchestrate malicious campaigns, and where targeted misinformation or scams are crafted with unparalleled precision. Welcome to the darker side of GenAI applications. This article is not just a journey through the meanders of potential misuse of GenAI and LLMs, but also a call to recognize the urgency of the challenges ahead. As we navigate the seas of misinformation campaigns, malicious content generation, and the eerie creation of sophisticated malware, we'll uncover the societal implications that ripple through the GenAI revolution we are witnessing. From AI-powered botnets on social media platforms to the unnerving potential of AI to generate fabricated identities, or alibis made of synthetic realities, the stakes have never been higher. The lines between the virtual and the real worlds are blurring, and the consequences of potential GenAI's nefarious applications impact us all. This article serves both as a synthesis of rigorous research presented on the risks of GenAI and misuse of LLMs and as a thought-provoking vision of the different types of harmful GenAI applications we might encounter in the near future, and some ways we can prepare for them.

> Current software supply chains heavily rely on open-source packages hosted in public repositories. Given the popularity of ecosystems like npm and PyPI, malicious users started to spread malware by publishing open-source packages containing malicious code. Recent works apply machine learning techniques to detect malicious packages in the npm ecosystem. However, the scarcity of samples poses a challenge to the application of machine learning techniques in other ecosystems. Despite the differences between JavaScript and Python, the open-source software supply chain attacks targeting such languages show noticeable similarities (e.g., use of installation scripts, obfuscated strings, URLs).   In this paper, we present a novel approach that involves a set of language-independent features and the training of models capable of detecting malicious packages in npm and PyPI by capturing their commonalities. This methodology allows us to train models on a diverse dataset encompassing multiple languages, thereby overcoming the challenge of limited sample availability. We evaluate the models both in a controlled experiment (where labels of data are known) and in the wild by scanning newly uploaded packages for both npm and PyPI for 10 days.   We find that our approach successfully detects malicious packages for both npm and PyPI. Over an analysis of 31,292 packages, we reported 58 previously unknown malicious packages (38 for npm and 20 for PyPI), which were consequently removed from the respective repositories.

> The last decades have been characterized by unprecedented technological advances, many of them powered by modern technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). The world has become more digitally connected than ever, but we face major challenges. One of the most significant is cybercrime, which has emerged as a global threat to governments, businesses, and civil societies. The pervasiveness of digital technologies combined with a constantly shifting technological foundation has created a complex and powerful playground for cybercriminals, which triggered a surge in demand for intelligent threat detection systems based on machine and deep learning. This paper investigates AI-based cyber threat detection to protect our modern digital ecosystems. The primary focus is on evaluating ML-based classifiers and ensembles for anomaly-based malware detection and network intrusion detection and how to integrate those models in the context of network security, mobile security, and IoT security. The discussion highlights the challenges when deploying and integrating AI-enabled cybersecurity solutions into existing enterprise systems and IT infrastructures, including options to overcome those challenges. Finally, the paper provides future research directions to further increase the security and resilience of our modern digital industries, infrastructures, and ecosystems.

> The explosive growth of cyber attacks nowadays, such as malware, spam, and intrusions, caused severe consequences on society. Securing cyberspace has become an utmost concern for organizations and governments. Traditional Machine Learning (ML) based methods are extensively used in detecting cyber threats, but they hardly model the correlations between real-world cyber entities. In recent years, with the proliferation of graph mining techniques, many researchers investigated these techniques for capturing correlations between cyber entities and achieving high performance. It is imperative to summarize existing graph-based cybersecurity solutions to provide a guide for future studies. Therefore, as a key contribution of this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of graph mining for cybersecurity, including an overview of cybersecurity tasks, the typical graph mining techniques, and the general process of applying them to cybersecurity, as well as various solutions for different cybersecurity tasks. For each task, we probe into relevant methods and highlight the graph types, graph approaches, and task levels in their modeling. Furthermore, we collect open datasets and toolkits for graph-based cybersecurity. Finally, we outlook the potential directions of this field for future research.

> Today, the security of many domains rely on the use of Machine Learning to detect threats, identify vulnerabilities, and safeguard systems from attacks. Recently, transformer architectures have improved the state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks such as malware detection and network intrusion detection. But, before abandoning current approaches to transformers, it is crucial to understand their properties and implications on cybersecurity applications. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of transformers to adversarial samples for system defenders (i.e., resiliency to adversarial perturbations generated on different types of architectures) and their adversarial strength for system attackers (i.e., transferability of adversarial samples generated by transformers to other target models). To that effect, we first fine-tune a set of pre-trained transformer, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and hybrid (an ensemble of transformer and CNN) models to solve different downstream image-based tasks. Then, we use an attack algorithm to craft 19,367 adversarial examples on each model for each task. The transferability of these adversarial examples is measured by evaluating each set on other models to determine which models offer more adversarial strength, and consequently, more robustness against these attacks. We find that the adversarial examples crafted on transformers offer the highest transferability rate (i.e., 25.7% higher than the average) onto other models. Similarly, adversarial examples crafted on other models have the lowest rate of transferability (i.e., 56.7% lower than the average) onto transformers. Our work emphasizes the importance of studying transformer architectures for attacking and defending models in security domains, and suggests using them as the primary architecture in transfer attack settings.

> Existing research on malware classification focuses almost exclusively on two tasks: distinguishing between malicious and benign files and classifying malware by family. However, malware can be categorized according to many other types of attributes, and the ability to identify these attributes in newly-emerging malware using machine learning could provide significant value to analysts. In particular, we have identified four tasks which are under-represented in prior work: classification by behaviors that malware exhibit, platforms that malware run on, vulnerabilities that malware exploit, and packers that malware are packed with. To obtain labels for training and evaluating ML classifiers on these tasks, we created an antivirus (AV) tagging tool called ClarAVy. ClarAVy's sophisticated AV label parser distinguishes itself from prior AV-based taggers, with the ability to accurately parse 882 different AV label formats used by 90 different AV products. We are releasing benchmark datasets for each of these four classification tasks, tagged using ClarAVy and comprising nearly 5.5 million malicious files in total. Our malware behavior dataset includes 75 distinct tags - nearly 7x more than the only prior benchmark dataset with behavioral tags. To our knowledge, we are the first to release datasets with malware platform and packer tags.

> The digital transformation has created a new digital space known as cyberspace. This new cyberspace has improved the workings of businesses, organizations, governments, society as a whole, and day to day life of an individual. With these improvements come new challenges, and one of the main challenges is security. The security of the new cyberspace is called cybersecurity. Cyberspace has created new technologies and environments such as cloud computing, smart devices, IoTs, and several others. To keep pace with these advancements in cyber technologies there is a need to expand research and develop new cybersecurity methods and tools to secure these domains and environments. This book is an effort to introduce the reader to the field of cybersecurity, highlight current issues and challenges, and provide future directions to mitigate or resolve them. The main specializations of cybersecurity covered in this book are software security, hardware security, the evolution of malware, biometrics, cyber intelligence, and cyber forensics. We must learn from the past, evolve our present and improve the future. Based on this objective, the book covers the past, present, and future of these main specializations of cybersecurity. The book also examines the upcoming areas of research in cyber intelligence, such as hybrid augmented and explainable artificial intelligence (AI). Human and AI collaboration can significantly increase the performance of a cybersecurity system. Interpreting and explaining machine learning models, i.e., explainable AI is an emerging field of study and has a lot of potentials to improve the role of AI in cybersecurity.

> Software security requirements have been traditionally considered as a non-functional attribute of the software. However, as more software started to provide services online, existing mechanisms of using firewalls and other hardware to secure software have lost their applicability. At the same time, under the current world circumstances, the increase of cyber-attacks on software is ever increasing. As a result, it is important to consider the security requirements of software during its design. To design security in the software, it is important to obtain the views of the developers and managers of the software. Also, it is important to evaluate if their viewpoints match or differ regarding the security. Conducting this communication through a specific model will enable the developers and managers to eliminate any doubts on security design and adopt an effective strategy to build security into the software. In this paper, we analyzed the viewpoints of developers and managers regarding their views on security design. We interviewed a team of 7 developers and 2 managers, who worked in two teams to build a real-life software product that was recently compromised by a cyber-attack. We obtained their views on the reasons for the successful attack by the malware and took their recommendations on the important aspects to consider regarding security. Based on their feedback, we coded their open-ended responses into 4 codes, which we recommended using for other real-life software as well.

> Malware authors have seen obfuscation as the mean to bypass malware detectors based on static analysis features. For Android, several studies have confirmed that many anti-malware products are easily evaded with simple program transformations. As opposed to these works, ML detection proposals for Android leveraging static analysis features have also been proposed as obfuscation-resilient. Therefore, it needs to be determined to what extent the use of a specific obfuscation strategy or tool poses a risk for the validity of ML malware detectors for Android based on static analysis features. To shed some light in this regard, in this article we assess the impact of specific obfuscation techniques on common features extracted using static analysis and determine whether the changes are significant enough to undermine the effectiveness of ML malware detectors that rely on these features. The experimental results suggest that obfuscation techniques affect all static analysis features to varying degrees across different tools. However, certain features retain their validity for ML malware detection even in the presence of obfuscation. Based on these findings, we propose a ML malware detector for Android that is robust against obfuscation and outperforms current state-of-the-art detectors.

> Randomized smoothing is a leading approach for constructing classifiers that are certifiably robust against adversarial examples. Existing work on randomized smoothing has focused on classifiers with continuous inputs, such as images, where $\ell_p$-norm bounded adversaries are commonly studied. However, there has been limited work for classifiers with discrete or variable-size inputs, such as for source code, which require different threat models and smoothing mechanisms. In this work, we adapt randomized smoothing for discrete sequence classifiers to provide certified robustness against edit distance-bounded adversaries. Our proposed smoothing mechanism randomized deletion (RS-Del) applies random deletion edits, which are (perhaps surprisingly) sufficient to confer robustness against adversarial deletion, insertion and substitution edits. Our proof of certification deviates from the established Neyman-Pearson approach, which is intractable in our setting, and is instead organized around longest common subsequences. We present a case study on malware detection--a binary classification problem on byte sequences where classifier evasion is a well-established threat model. When applied to the popular MalConv malware detection model, our smoothing mechanism RS-Del achieves a certified accuracy of 91% at an edit distance radius of 128 bytes.

> The emergence of WebAssembly allows attackers to hide the malicious functionalities of JavaScript malware in cross-language interoperations, termed JavaScript-WebAssembly multilingual malware (JWMM). However, existing anti-virus solutions based on static program analysis are still limited to monolingual code. As a result, their detection effectiveness decreases significantly against JWMM. The detection of JWMM is challenging due to the complex interoperations and semantic diversity between JavaScript and WebAssembly. To bridge this gap, we present JWBinder, the first technique aimed at enhancing the static detection of JWMM. JWBinder performs a language-specific data-flow analysis to capture the cross-language interoperations and then characterizes the functionalities of JWMM through a unified high-level structure called Inter-language Program Dependency Graph. The extensive evaluation on one of the most representative real-world anti-virus platforms, VirusTotal, shows that \system effectively enhances anti-virus systems from various vendors and increases the overall successful detection rate against JWMM from 49.1\% to 86.2\%. Additionally, we assess the side effects and runtime overhead of JWBinder, corroborating its practical viability in real-world applications.

> Domain fronting is a network communication technique that involves leveraging (or abusing) content delivery networks (CDNs) to disguise the final destination of network packets by presenting them as if they were intended for a different domain than their actual endpoint. This technique can be used for both benign and malicious purposes, such as circumventing censorship or hiding malware-related communications from network security systems. Since domain fronting has been known for a few years, some popular CDN providers have implemented traffic filtering approaches to curb its use at their CDN infrastructure. However, it remains unclear to what extent domain fronting has been mitigated.   To better understand whether domain fronting can still be effectively used, we propose a systematic approach to discover CDNs that are still prone to domain fronting. To this end, we leverage passive and active DNS traffic analysis to pinpoint domain names served by CDNs and build an automated tool that can be used to discover CDNs that allow domain fronting in their infrastructure. Our results reveal that domain fronting is feasible in 22 out of 30 CDNs that we tested, including some major CDN providers like Akamai and Fastly. This indicates that domain fronting remains widely available and can be easily abused for malicious purposes.

> Analysing malware is important to understand how malicious software works and to develop appropriate detection and prevention methods. Dynamic analysis can overcome evasion techniques commonly used to bypass static analysis and provide insights into malware runtime activities. Much research on dynamic analysis focused on investigating machine-level information (e.g., CPU, memory, network usage) to identify whether a machine is running malicious activities. A malicious machine does not necessarily mean all running processes on the machine are also malicious. If we can isolate the malicious process instead of isolating the whole machine, we could kill the malicious process, and the machine can keep doing its job. Another challenge dynamic malware detection research faces is that the samples are executed in one machine without any background applications running. It is unrealistic as a computer typically runs many benign (background) applications when a malware incident happens. Our experiment with machine-level data shows that the existence of background applications decreases previous state-of-the-art accuracy by about 20.12% on average. We also proposed a process-level Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based detection model. Our proposed model performs better than the machine-level detection model; 0.049 increase in detection rate and a false-positive rate below 0.1.

This technique can be used for both benign and malicious purposes, such as circumventing censorship or hiding malware-related communications from network security systems. Since domain fronting has been known for a few years, some popular CDN providers have implemented traffic filtering approaches to curb its use at their CDN infrastructure. However, it remains unclear to what extent domain fronting has been mitigated.   To better understand whether domain fronting can still be effectively used, we propose a systematic approach to discover CDNs that are still prone to domain fronting. To this end, we leverage passive and active DNS traffic analysis to pinpoint domain names served by CDNs and build an automated tool that can be used to discover CDNs that allow domain fronting in their infrastructure. Our results reveal that domain fronting is feasible in 22 out of 30 CDNs that we tested, including some major CDN providers like Akamai and Fastly. This indicates that domain fronting remains widely available and can be easily abused for malicious purposes.

> Deep learning (DL) has proven to be effective in detecting sophisticated malware that is constantly evolving. Even though deep learning has alleviated the feature engineering problem, finding the most optimal DL model, in terms of neural architecture search (NAS) and the model's optimal set of hyper-parameters, remains a challenge that requires domain expertise. In addition, many of the proposed state-of-the-art models are very complex and may not be the best fit for different datasets. A promising approach, known as Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), can reduce the domain expertise required to implement a custom DL model. AutoML reduces the amount of human trial-and-error involved in designing DL models, and in more recent implementations can find new model architectures with relatively low computational overhead.   This work provides a comprehensive analysis and insights on using AutoML for static and online malware detection. For static, our analysis is performed on two widely used malware datasets: SOREL-20M to demonstrate efficacy on large datasets; and EMBER-2018, a smaller dataset specifically curated to hinder the performance of machine learning models. In addition, we show the effects of tuning the NAS process parameters on finding a more optimal malware detection model on these static analysis datasets. Further, we also demonstrate that AutoML is performant in online malware detection scenarios using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for cloud IaaS. We compare an AutoML technique to six existing state-of-the-art CNNs using a newly generated online malware dataset with and without other applications running in the background during malware execution.In general, our experimental results show that the performance of AutoML based static and online malware detection models are on par or even better than state-of-the-art models or hand-designed models presented in literature.

> In the modern era, malware is experiencing a significant increase in both its variety and quantity, aligning with the widespread adoption of the digital world. This surge in malware has emerged as a critical challenge in the realm of cybersecurity, prompting numerous research endeavors and contributions to address the issue. Machine learning algorithms have been leveraged for malware detection due to their ability to uncover concealed patterns within vast datasets. However, deep learning algorithms, characterized by their multi-layered structure, surpass the limitations of traditional machine learning approaches. By employing deep learning techniques such as CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), this study aims to classify and identify malware extracted from a dataset containing API call sequences. The performance of these algorithms is compared with that of conventional machine learning methods, including SVM (Support Vector Machine), RF (Random Forest), KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), XGB (Extreme Gradient Boosting), and GBC (Gradient Boosting Classifier), all using the same dataset. The outcomes of this research demonstrate that both deep learning and machine learning algorithms achieve remarkably high levels of accuracy, reaching up to 99% in certain cases.

> Smart healthcare, an integral element of connected living, plays a pivotal role in fulfilling a fundamental human need. The burgeoning field of smart healthcare is poised to generate substantial revenue in the foreseeable future. Its multifaceted framework encompasses vital components such as the Internet of Things (IoT), medical sensors, artificial intelligence (AI), edge and cloud computing, as well as next-generation wireless communication technologies. Many research papers discuss smart healthcare and healthcare more broadly. Numerous nations have strategically deployed the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) alongside other measures to combat the propagation of COVID-19. This combined effort has not only enhanced the safety of frontline healthcare workers but has also augmented the overall efficacy in managing the pandemic, subsequently reducing its impact on human lives and mortality rates. Remarkable strides have been made in both applications and technology within the IoMT domain. However, it is imperative to acknowledge that this technological advancement has introduced certain challenges, particularly in the realm of security. The rapid and extensive adoption of IoMT worldwide has magnified issues related to security and privacy. These encompass a spectrum of concerns, ranging from replay attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, impersonation, privileged insider threats, remote hijacking, password guessing, and denial of service (DoS) attacks, to malware incursions. In this comprehensive review, we undertake a comparative analysis of existing strategies designed for the detection and prevention of malware in IoT environments.

> With the booming popularity of smartphones, threats related to these devices are increasingly on the rise. Smishing, a combination of SMS (Short Message Service) and phishing has emerged as a treacherous cyber threat used by malicious actors to deceive users, aiming to steal sensitive information, money or install malware on their mobile devices. Despite the increase in smishing attacks in recent years, there are very few studies aimed at understanding the factors that contribute to a user's ability to differentiate real from fake messages.   To address this gap in knowledge, we have conducted an online survey on smishing detection with 214 participants. In this study, we presented them with 16 SMS screenshots and evaluated how different factors affect their decision making process in smishing detection. Next, we conducted a follow-up survey to garner information on the participants' security attitudes, behavior and knowledge. Our results highlighted that attention and security behavioral scores had a significant impact on participants' accuracy identifying smishing messages. Interestingly, we found that participants had more difficulty identifying real messages from fake ones, with an accuracy of 64% with fake messages and 46\% with real messages. Understanding these factors is pivotal to bolstering users' resilience against these threats and to create a safer digital environment.

> Ransomware is a type of malware which encrypts user data and extorts payments in return for the decryption keys. This cyberthreat is one of the most serious challenges facing organizations today and has already caused immense financial damage. As a result, many researchers have been developing techniques to counter ransomware. Recently, the federated learning (FL) approach has also been applied for ransomware analysis, allowing corporations to achieve scalable, effective detection and attribution without having to share their private data. However, in reality there is much variation in the quantity and composition of ransomware data collected across multiple FL client sites/regions. This imbalance will inevitably degrade the effectiveness of any defense mechanisms. To address this concern, a modified FL scheme is proposed using a weighted cross-entropy loss function approach to mitigate dataset imbalance. A detailed performance evaluation study is then presented for the case of static analysis using the latest Windows-based ransomware families. The findings confirm improved ML classifier performance for a highly imbalanced dataset.

> Ransomware has remained one of the most notorious threats in the cybersecurity field. Moving Target Defense (MTD) has been proposed as a novel paradigm for proactive defense. Although various approaches leverage MTD, few of them rely on the operating system and, specifically, the file system, thereby making them dependent on other computing devices. Furthermore, existing ransomware defense techniques merely replicate or detect attacks, without preventing them. Thus, this paper introduces the MTFS overlay file system and the design and implementation of three novel MTD techniques implemented on top of it. One delaying attackers, one trapping recursive directory traversal, and another one hiding file types. The effectiveness of the techniques are shown in two experiments. First, it is shown that the techniques can delay and mitigate ransomware on real IoT devices. Secondly, in a broader scope, the solution was confronted with 14 ransomware samples, highlighting that it can save 97% of the files.

> Embedded devices are specialised devices designed for one or only a few purposes. They are often part of a larger system, through wired or wireless connection. Those embedded devices that are connected to other computers or embedded systems through the Internet are called Internet of Things (IoT for short) devices.   With their widespread usage and their insufficient protection, these devices are increasingly becoming the target of malware attacks. Companies often cut corners to save manufacturing costs or misconfigure when producing these devices. This can be lack of software updates, ports left open or security defects by design. Although these devices may not be as powerful as a regular computer, their large number makes them suitable candidates for botnets. Other types of IoT devices can even cause health problems since there are even pacemakers connected to the Internet. This means, that without sufficient defence, even directed assaults are possible against people.   The goal of this thesis project is to provide better security for these devices with the help of machine learning algorithms and reverse engineering tools. Specifically, I study the applicability of control-flow related data of executables for malware detection. I present a malware detection method with two phases. The first phase extracts control-flow related data using static binary analysis. The second phase classifies binary executables as either malicious or benign using a neural network model. I train the model using a dataset of malicious and benign ARM applications.

> The continuous rise in the adoption of emerging technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) by businesses has brought unprecedented opportunities for innovation and growth. However, due to the distinct characteristics of these emerging IoT technologies like real-time data processing, Self-configuration, interoperability, and scalability, they have also introduced some unique cybersecurity challenges, such as malware attacks, advanced persistent threats (APTs), DoS /DDoS (Denial of Service & Distributed Denial of Service attacks) and insider threats. As a result of these challenges, there is an increased need for improved cybersecurity approaches and efficient management solutions to ensure the privacy and security of communication within IoT networks. One proposed security approach is the utilization of trust-based systems and is the focus of this study. This research paper presents a systematic literature review on the Trust-based cybersecurity security approaches for IoT. A total of 23 articles were identified that satisfy the review criteria. We highlighted the common trust-based mitigation techniques in existence for dealing with these threats and grouped them into three major categories, namely: Observation-Based, Knowledge-Based & Cluster-Based systems. Finally, several open issues were highlighted, and future research directions presented.

> This paper proposes a novel method of classifying malware into families using high-resolution greyscale images and multiple instance learning to overcome adversarial binary enlargement. Current methods of visualisation-based malware classification largely rely on lossy transformations of inputs such as resizing to handle the large, variable-sized images. Through empirical analysis and experimentation, it is shown that these approaches cause crucial information loss that can be exploited. The proposed solution divides the images into patches and uses embedding-based multiple instance learning with a convolutional neural network and an attention aggregation function for classification. The implementation is evaluated on the Microsoft Malware Classification dataset and achieves accuracies of up to $96.6\%$ on adversarially enlarged samples compared to the baseline of $22.8\%$. The Python code is available online at https://github.com/timppeters/MIL-Malware-Images .

> Numerous open-source and commercial malware detectors are available. However, their efficacy is threatened by new adversarial attacks, whereby malware attempts to evade detection, e.g., by performing feature-space manipulation. In this work, we propose an explainability-guided and model-agnostic testing framework for robustness of malware detectors when confronted with adversarial attacks. The framework introduces the concept of Accrued Malicious Magnitude (AMM) to identify which malware features could be manipulated to maximize the likelihood of evading detection. We then use this framework to test several state-of-the-art malware detectors' abilities to detect manipulated malware. We find that (i) commercial antivirus engines are vulnerable to AMM-guided test cases; (ii) the ability of a manipulated malware generated using one detector to evade detection by another detector (i.e., transferability) depends on the overlap of features with large AMM values between the different detectors; and (iii) AMM values effectively measure the fragility of features (i.e., capability of feature-space manipulation to flip the prediction results) and explain the robustness of malware detectors facing evasion attacks. Our findings shed light on the limitations of current malware detectors, as well as how they can be improved.

> Being able to identify functions of interest in cross-architecture software is useful whether you are analysing for malware, securing the software supply chain or conducting vulnerability research. Cross-Architecture Binary Code Similarity Search has been explored in numerous studies and has used a wide range of different data sources to achieve its goals. The data sources typically used draw on common structures derived from binaries such as function control flow graphs or binary level call graphs, the output of the disassembly process or the outputs of a dynamic analysis approach. One data source which has received less attention is binary intermediate representations. Binary Intermediate representations possess two interesting properties: they are cross architecture by their very nature and encode the semantics of a function explicitly to support downstream usage. Within this paper we propose Function as a String Encoded Representation (FASER) which combines long document transformers with the use of intermediate representations to create a model capable of cross architecture function search without the need for manual feature engineering, pre-training or a dynamic analysis step. We compare our approach against a series of baseline approaches for two tasks; A general function search task and a targeted vulnerability search task. Our approach demonstrates strong performance across both tasks, performing better than all baseline approaches.

> Digital Imaging and Communication System (DICOM) is widely used throughout the public health sector for portability in medical imaging. However, these DICOM files have vulnerabilities present in the preamble section. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can allow attackers to embed executable codes in the 128-Byte preamble of DICOM files. Embedding the malicious executable will not interfere with the readability or functionality of DICOM imagery. However, it will affect the underline system silently upon viewing these files. This paper shows the infiltration of Windows malware executables into DICOM files. On viewing the files, the malicious DICOM will get executed and eventually infect the entire hospital network through the radiologist's workstation. The code injection process of executing malware in DICOM files affects the hospital networks and workstations' memory. Memory forensics for the infected radiologist's workstation is crucial as it can detect which malware disrupts the hospital environment, and future detection methods can be deployed. In this paper, we consider the machine learning (ML) algorithms to conduct memory forensics on three memory dump categories: Trojan, Spyware, and Ransomware, taken from the CIC-MalMem-2022 dataset. We obtain the highest accuracy of 75\% with the Random Forest model. For estimating the feature importance for ML model prediction, we leveraged the concept of Shapley values.

> As the Internet of Things (IoT) has become truly ubiquitous, so has the surrounding threat landscape. However, while the security of classical computing systems has significantly matured in the last decades, IoT cybersecurity is still typically low or fully neglected. This paper provides a classification of IoT malware. Major targets and used exploits for attacks are identified and referred to the specific malware. The lack of standard definitions of IoT devices and, therefore, security goals has been identified during this research as a profound barrier in advancing IoT cybersecurity. Furthermore, standardized reporting of IoT malware by trustworthy sources is required in the field. The majority of current IoT attacks continue to be of comparably low effort and level of sophistication and could be mitigated by existing technical measures.

> The acceptance and widespread use of the Android operating system drew the attention of both legitimate developers and malware authors, which resulted in a significant number of benign and malicious applications available on various online markets. Since the signature-based methods fall short for detecting malicious software effectively considering the vast number of applications, machine learning techniques in this field have also become widespread. In this context, stating the acquired accuracy values in the contingency tables in malware detection studies has become a popular and efficient method and enabled researchers to evaluate their methodologies comparatively. In this study, we wanted to investigate and emphasize the factors that may affect the accuracy values of the models managed by researchers, particularly the disassembly method and the input data characteristics. Firstly, we developed a model that tackles the malware detection problem from a Natural Language Processing (NLP) perspective using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Then, we experimented with different base units (instruction, basic block, method, and class) and representations of source code obtained from three commonly used disassembling tools (JEB, IDA, and Apktool) and examined the results. Our findings exhibit that the disassembly method and different input representations affect the model results. More specifically, the datasets collected by the Apktool achieved better results compared to the other two disassemblers.

> In recent years there has been a dramatic increase in the number of malware attacks that use encrypted HTTP traffic for self-propagation or communication. Antivirus software and firewalls typically will not have access to encryption keys, and therefore direct detection of malicious encrypted data is unlikely to succeed. However, previous work has shown that traffic analysis can provide indications of malicious intent, even in cases where the underlying data remains encrypted. In this paper, we apply three machine learning techniques to the problem of distinguishing malicious encrypted HTTP traffic from benign encrypted traffic and obtain results comparable to previous work. We then consider the problem of feature analysis in some detail. Previous work has often relied on human expertise to determine the most useful and informative features in this problem domain. We demonstrate that such feature-related information can be obtained directly from machine learning models themselves. We argue that such a machine learning based approach to feature analysis is preferable, as it is more reliable, and we can, for example, uncover relatively unintuitive interactions between features.

> Digital Imaging and Communication System (DICOM) is widely used throughout the public health sector for portability in medical imaging. However, these DICOM files have vulnerabilities present in the preamble section. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can allow attackers to embed executable codes in the 128-Byte preamble of DICOM files. Embedding the malicious executable will not interfere with the readability or functionality of DICOM imagery. However, it will affect the underline system silently upon viewing these files. This paper shows the infiltration of Windows malware executables into DICOM files. On viewing the files, the malicious DICOM will get executed and eventually infect the entire hospital network through the radiologist's workstation. The code injection process of executing malware in DICOM files affects the hospital networks and workstations' memory. Memory forensics for the infected radiologist's workstation is crucial as it can detect which malware disrupts the hospital environment, and future detection methods can be deployed. In this paper, we consider the machine learning (ML) algorithms to conduct memory forensics on three memory dump categories: Trojan, Spyware, and Ransomware, taken from the CIC-MalMem-2022 dataset. We obtain the highest accuracy of 75% with the Random Forest model. For estimating the feature importance for ML model prediction, we leveraged the concept of Shapley values.

> Machine learning (ML) has gained significant adoption in Android malware detection to address the escalating threats posed by the rapid proliferation of malware attacks. However, recent studies have revealed the inherent vulnerabilities of ML-based detection systems to evasion attacks. While efforts have been made to address this critical issue, many of the existing defensive methods encounter challenges such as lower effectiveness or reduced generalization capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel Android malware detection method, MalPurifier, which exploits adversarial purification to eliminate perturbations independently, resulting in attack mitigation in a light and flexible way. Specifically, MalPurifier employs a Denoising AutoEncoder (DAE)-based purification model to preprocess input samples, removing potential perturbations from them and then leading to correct classification. To enhance defense effectiveness, we propose a diversified adversarial perturbation mechanism that strengthens the purification model against different manipulations from various evasion attacks. We also incorporate randomized "protective noises" onto benign samples to prevent excessive purification. Furthermore, we customize a loss function for improving the DAE model, combining reconstruction loss and prediction loss, to enhance feature representation learning, resulting in accurate reconstruction and classification. Experimental results on two Android malware datasets demonstrate that MalPurifier outperforms the state-of-the-art defenses, and it significantly strengthens the vulnerable malware detector against 37 evasion attacks, achieving accuracies over 90.91%. Notably, MalPurifier demonstrates easy scalability to other detectors, offering flexibility and robustness in its implementation.

> Prompt injection has emerged as a serious security threat to large language models (LLMs). At present, the current best-practice for defending against newly-discovered prompt injection techniques is to add additional guardrails to the system (e.g., by updating the system prompt or using classifiers on the input and/or output of the model.) However, in the same way that variants of a piece of malware are created to evade anti-virus software, variants of a prompt injection can be created to evade the LLM's guardrails. Ideally, when a new prompt injection technique is discovered, candidate defenses should be tested not only against the successful prompt injection, but also against possible variants.   In this work, we present, a tool to assist defenders in performing automated variant analysis of known prompt injection attacks. This involves solving two main challenges: (1) automatically generating variants of a given prompt according, and (2) automatically determining whether a variant was effective based only on the output of the model. This tool can also assist in generating datasets for jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, thus overcoming the scarcity of data in this domain.   We evaluate Maatphor on three different types of prompt injection tasks. Starting from an ineffective (0%) seed prompt, Maatphor consistently generates variants that are at least 60% effective within the first 40 iterations.

> Smart meters are of the basic elements in the so-called Smart Grid. These devices, connected to the Internet, keep bidirectional communication with other devices in the Smart Grid structure to allow remote readings and maintenance. As any other device connected to a network, smart meters become vulnerable to attacks with different purposes, like stealing data or altering readings. Nowadays, it is becoming more and more popular to buy and plug-and-play smart meters, additionally to those installed by the energy providers, to directly monitor the energy consumption at home. This option inherently entails security risks that are under the responsibility of householders. In this paper, we focus on an open solution based on Smartpi 2.0 devices with two purposes. On the one hand, we propose a network configuration and different data flows to exchange data (energy readings) in the home. These flows are designed to support collaborative among the devices in order to prevent external attacks and attempts of corrupting the data. On the other hand, we check the vulnerability by performing two kind of attacks (denial of service and stealing and changing data by using a malware). We conclude that, as expected, these devices are vulnerable to these attacks, but we provide mechanisms to detect both of them and to solve, by applying cooperation techniques

> Dynamic analysis methods effectively identify shelled, wrapped, or obfuscated malware, thereby preventing them from invading computers. As a significant representation of dynamic malware behavior, the API (Application Programming Interface) sequence, comprised of consecutive API calls, has progressively become the dominant feature of dynamic analysis methods. Though there have been numerous deep learning models for malware detection based on API sequences, the quality of API call representations produced by those models is limited. These models cannot generate representations for unknown API calls, which weakens both the detection performance and the generalization. Further, the concept drift phenomenon of API calls is prominent. To tackle these issues, we introduce a prompt engineering-assisted malware dynamic analysis using GPT-4. In this method, GPT-4 is employed to create explanatory text for each API call within the API sequence. Afterward, the pre-trained language model BERT is used to obtain the representation of the text, from which we derive the representation of the API sequence. Theoretically, this proposed method is capable of generating representations for all API calls, excluding the necessity for dataset training during the generation process. Utilizing the representation, a CNN-based detection model is designed to extract the feature. We adopt five benchmark datasets to validate the performance of the proposed model. The experimental results reveal that the proposed detection algorithm performs better than the state-of-the-art method (TextCNN). Specifically, in cross-database experiments and few-shot learning experiments, the proposed model achieves excellent detection performance and almost a 100% recall rate for malware, verifying its superior generalization performance.

> As the number and complexity of malware attacks continue to increase, there is an urgent need for effective malware detection systems. While deep learning models are effective at detecting malware, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Attacks like this can create malicious files that are resistant to detection, creating a significant cybersecurity risk. Recent research has seen the development of several adversarial attack and response approaches aiming at strengthening deep learning models' resilience to such attacks. This survey study offers an in-depth look at current research in adversarial attack and defensive strategies for malware classification in cybersecurity. The methods are classified into four categories: generative models, feature-based approaches, ensemble methods, and hybrid tactics. The article outlines cutting-edge procedures within each area, assessing their benefits and drawbacks. Each topic presents cutting-edge approaches and explores their advantages and disadvantages. In addition, the study discusses the datasets and assessment criteria that are often utilized on this subject. Finally, it identifies open research difficulties and suggests future study options. This document is a significant resource for malware categorization and cyber security researchers and practitioners.

> The impressive growth of smartphone devices in combination with the rising ubiquity of using mobile platforms for sensitive applications such as Internet banking, have triggered a rapid increase in mobile malware. In recent literature, many studies examine Machine Learning techniques, as the most promising approach for mobile malware detection, without however quantifying the uncertainty involved in their detections. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a machine learning dynamic analysis approach that provides provably valid confidence guarantees in each malware detection. Moreover the particular guarantees hold for both the malicious and benign classes independently and are unaffected by any bias in the data. The proposed approach is based on a novel machine learning framework, called Conformal Prediction, combined with a random forests classifier. We examine its performance on a large-scale dataset collected by installing 1866 malicious and 4816 benign applications on a real android device. We make this collection of dynamic analysis data available to the research community. The obtained experimental results demonstrate the empirical validity, usefulness and unbiased nature of the outputs produced by the proposed approach.

> Malware detection is an important topic of current cybersecurity, and Machine Learning appears to be one of the main considered solutions even if certain problems to generalize to new malware remain. In the aim of exploring the potential of quantum machine learning on this domain, our previous work showed that quantum neural networks do not perform well on image-based malware detection when using a few qubits. In order to enhance the performances of our quantum algorithms for malware detection using images, without increasing the resources needed in terms of qubits, we implement a new preprocessing of our dataset using Grayscale method, and we couple it with a model composed of five distributed quantum convolutional networks and a scoring function. We get an increase of around 20 \% of our results, both on the accuracy of the test and its F1-score.

> Malware represents a significant security concern in today's digital landscape, as it can destroy or disable operating systems, steal sensitive user information, and occupy valuable disk space. However, current malware detection methods, such as static-based and dynamic-based approaches, struggle to identify newly developed (``zero-day") malware and are limited by customized virtual machine (VM) environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel malware detection approach that leverages deep learning, mathematical techniques, and network science. Our approach focuses on static and dynamic analysis and utilizes the Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) to profile applications within a complex network. The generated network topologies are input into the GraphSAGE architecture to efficiently distinguish between benign and malicious software applications, with the operation names denoted as node features. Importantly, the GraphSAGE models analyze the network's topological geometry to make predictions, enabling them to detect state-of-the-art malware and prevent potential damage during execution in a VM. To evaluate our approach, we conduct a study on a dataset comprising source code from 24,376 applications, specifically written in C/C++, sourced directly from widely-recognized malware and various types of benign software. The results show a high detection performance with an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 99.85%. Our approach marks a substantial improvement in malware detection, providing a notably more accurate and efficient solution when compared to current state-of-the-art malware detection methods.

> Clickbait PDFs are PDF documents that do not embed malware but trick victims into visiting malicious web pages leading to attacks like password theft or drive-by download. While recent reports indicate a surge of clickbait PDFs, prior works have largely neglected this new threat, considering PDFs only as accessories of email phishing campaigns.   This paper investigates the landscape of clickbait PDFs and presents the first systematic and comprehensive study of this phenomenon. Starting from a real-world dataset, we identify 44 clickbait PDF clusters via clustering and characterize them by looking at their volumetric, temporal, and visual features. Among these, we identify three large clusters covering 89% of the dataset, exhibiting significantly different volumetric and temporal properties compared to classical email phishing, and relying on web UI elements as visual baits. Finally, we look at the distribution vectors and show that clickbait PDFs are not only distributed via attachments but also via Search Engine Optimization attacks, placing clickbait PDFs outside the email distribution ecosystem.   Clickbait PDFs seem to be a lurking threat, not subjected to any form of content-based filtering or detection: AV scoring systems, like VirusTotal, rank them considerably low, creating a blind spot for organizations. While URL blocklists can help to prevent victims from visiting the attack web pages, we observe that they have a limited coverage.

> Industry practitioners care about small improvements in malware detection accuracy because their models are deployed to hundreds of millions of machines, meaning a 0.1\% change can cause an overwhelming number of false positives. However, academic research is often restrained to public datasets on the order of ten thousand samples and is too small to detect improvements that may be relevant to industry. Working within these constraints, we devise an approach to generate a benchmark of configurable difficulty from a pool of available samples. This is done by leveraging malware family information from tools like AVClass to construct training/test splits that have different generalization rates, as measured by a secondary model. Our experiments will demonstrate that using a less accurate secondary model with disparate features is effective at producing benchmarks for a more sophisticated target model that is under evaluation. We also ablate against alternative designs to show the need for our approach.

> Android malware still represents the most significant threat to mobile systems. While Machine Learning systems are increasingly used to identify these threats, past studies have revealed that attackers can bypass these detection mechanisms by making subtle changes to Android applications, such as adding specific API calls. These modifications are often referred to as No OPerations (NOP), which ideally should not alter the semantics of the program. However, many NOPs can be spotted and eliminated by refining the app analysis process. This paper proposes a visibility metric that assesses the difficulty in spotting NOPs and similar non-operational codes. We tested our metric on a state-of-the-art, opcode-based deep learning system for Android malware detection. We implemented attacks on the feature and problem spaces and calculated their visibility according to our metric. The attained results show an intriguing trade-off between evasion efficacy and detectability: our metric can be valuable to ensure the real effectiveness of an adversarial attack, also serving as a useful aid to develop better defenses.
