> Context: Cybersecurity vendors often publish cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports, referring to the written artifacts on technical and forensic analysis of the techniques used by the malware in APT attacks. Objective: The goal of this research is to inform cybersecurity practitioners about how adversaries form cyberattacks through an analysis of adversarial techniques documented in cyberthreat intelligence reports. Dataset: We use 594 adversarial techniques cataloged in MITRE ATT\&CK. We systematically construct a set of 667 CTI reports that MITRE ATT\&CK used as citations in the descriptions of the cataloged adversarial techniques. Methodology: We analyze the frequency and trend of adversarial techniques, followed by a qualitative analysis of the implementation of techniques. Next, we perform association rule mining to identify pairs of techniques recurring in APT attacks. We then perform qualitative analysis to identify the underlying relations among the techniques in the recurring pairs. Findings: The set of 667 CTI reports documents 10,370 techniques in total, and we identify 19 prevalent techniques accounting for 37.3\% of documented techniques. We also identify 425 statistically significant recurring pairs and seven types of relations among the techniques in these pairs. The top three among the seven relationships suggest that techniques used by the malware inter-relate with one another in terms of (a) abusing or affecting the same system assets, (b) executing in sequences, and (c) overlapping in their implementations. Overall, the study quantifies how adversaries leverage techniques through malware in APT attacks based on publicly reported documents. We advocate organizations prioritize their defense against the identified prevalent techniques and actively hunt for potential malicious intrusion based on the identified pairs of techniques.

- `2401.01883v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01883v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01883v1)

> Defending from cyberattacks requires practitioners to operate on high-level adversary behavior. Cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) reports on past cyberattack incidents describe the chain of malicious actions with respect to time. To avoid repeating cyberattack incidents, practitioners must proactively identify and defend against recurring chain of actions - which we refer to as temporal attack patterns. Automatically mining the patterns among actions provides structured and actionable information on the adversary behavior of past cyberattacks. The goal of this paper is to aid security practitioners in prioritizing and proactive defense against cyberattacks by mining temporal attack patterns from cyberthreat intelligence reports. To this end, we propose ChronoCTI, an automated pipeline for mining temporal attack patterns from cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) reports of past cyberattacks. To construct ChronoCTI, we build the ground truth dataset of temporal attack patterns and apply state-of-the-art large language models, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques. We apply ChronoCTI on a set of 713 CTI reports, where we identify 124 temporal attack patterns - which we categorize into nine pattern categories. We identify that the most prevalent pattern category is to trick victim users into executing malicious code to initiate the attack, followed by bypassing the anti-malware system in the victim network. Based on the observed patterns, we advocate organizations to train users about cybersecurity best practices, introduce immutable operating systems with limited functionalities, and enforce multi-user authentications. Moreover, we advocate practitioners to leverage the automated mining capability of ChronoCTI and design countermeasures against the recurring attack patterns.

- *Jiayi Hua, Kailong Wang, Meizhen Wang, Guangdong Bai, Xiapu Luo, Haoyu Wang*

- `2401.02659v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02659v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02659v1)

> Mobile malware has become one of the most critical security threats in the era of ubiquitous mobile computing. Despite the intensive efforts from security experts to counteract it, recent years have still witnessed a rapid growth of identified malware samples. This could be partly attributed to the newly-emerged technologies that may constantly open up under-studied attack surfaces for the adversaries. One typical example is the recently-developed mobile machine learning (ML) framework that enables storing and running deep learning (DL) models on mobile devices. Despite obvious advantages, this new feature also inadvertently introduces potential vulnerabilities (e.g., on-device models may be modified for malicious purposes). In this work, we propose a method to generate or transform mobile malware by hiding the malicious payloads inside the parameters of deep learning models, based on a strategy that considers four factors (layer type, layer number, layer coverage and the number of bytes to replace). Utilizing the proposed method, we can run malware in DL mobile applications covertly with little impact on the model performance (i.e., as little as 0.4% drop in accuracy and at most 39ms latency overhead).

- *Jonathan Magnusson*

- `2401.03864v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03864v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03864v1)

> The Domain Name System (DNS) comprises name servers translating domain names into, commonly, IP addresses. Authoritative name servers hosts the resource records (RR) for certain zones, and resolver name servers are responsible for querying and answering DNS queries on behalf of their clients. Unfortunately, cybercriminals often use DNS for malicious purposes, such as phishing, malware distribution, and botnet communication. To combat these threats, filtering resolvers have become increasingly popular, employing various techniques to identify and block malicious requests. In this paper, we survey several techniques to implement and enhance the capabilities of filtering resolvers including response policy zones, threat intelligence feeds, and detection of algorithmically generated domains. We identify the current trends of each area and find missing intersections in the literature, which could be used to improve the effectiveness of filtering resolvers. In addition, we propose future work designing a framework for filtering resolvers using state-of-the-art approaches identified in this study.

- *Federico Barbero, Feargus Pendlebury, Fabio Pierazzi, Lorenzo Cavallaro*

- `2010.03856v6` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03856v6) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.03856v6)

> Machine learning for malware classification shows encouraging results, but real deployments suffer from performance degradation as malware authors adapt their techniques to evade detection. This phenomenon, known as concept drift, occurs as new malware examples evolve and become less and less like the original training examples. One promising method to cope with concept drift is classification with rejection in which examples that are likely to be misclassified are instead quarantined until they can be expertly analyzed.   We propose TRANSCENDENT, a rejection framework built on Transcend, a recently proposed strategy based on conformal prediction theory. In particular, we provide a formal treatment of Transcend, enabling us to refine conformal evaluation theory -- its underlying statistical engine -- and gain a better understanding of the theoretical reasons for its effectiveness. In the process, we develop two additional conformal evaluators that match or surpass the performance of the original while significantly decreasing the computational overhead. We evaluate TRANSCENDENT on a malware dataset spanning 5 years that removes sources of experimental bias present in the original evaluation. TRANSCENDENT outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while generalizing across different malware domains and classifiers.   To further assist practitioners, we determine the optimal operational settings for a TRANSCENDENT deployment and show how it can be applied to many popular learning algorithms. These insights support both old and new empirical findings, making Transcend a sound and practical solution for the first time. To this end, we release TRANSCENDENT as open source, to aid the adoption of rejection strategies by the security community.

- *Irfan Ozen, Karthika Subramani, Phani Vadrevu, Roberto Perdisci*

- `2401.05569v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05569v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05569v1)

> Social engineering (SE) aims at deceiving users into performing actions that may compromise their security and privacy. These threats exploit weaknesses in human's decision making processes by using tactics such as pretext, baiting, impersonation, etc. On the web, SE attacks include attack classes such as scareware, tech support scams, survey scams, sweepstakes, etc., which can result in sensitive data leaks, malware infections, and monetary loss. For instance, US consumers lose billions of dollars annually due to various SE attacks. Unfortunately, generic social engineering attacks remain understudied, compared to other important threats, such as software vulnerabilities and exploitation, network intrusions, malicious software, and phishing. The few existing technical studies that focus on social engineering are limited in scope and mostly focus on measurements rather than developing a generic defense. To fill this gap, we present SEShield, a framework for in-browser detection of social engineering attacks. SEShield consists of three main components: (i) a custom security crawler, called SECrawler, that is dedicated to scouting the web to collect examples of in-the-wild SE attacks; (ii) SENet, a deep learning-based image classifier trained on data collected by SECrawler that aims to detect the often glaring visual traits of SE attack pages; and (iii) SEGuard, a proof-of-concept extension that embeds SENet into the web browser and enables real-time SE attack detection. We perform an extensive evaluation of our system and show that SENet is able to detect new instances of SE attacks with a detection rate of up to 99.6% at 1% false positive, thus providing an effective first defense against SE attacks on the web.

- *Shoumik Saha, Sadia Afroz, Atif Rahman*

- `2111.14185v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14185v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14185v3)

> For a long time, malware classification and analysis have been an arms-race between antivirus systems and malware authors. Though static analysis is vulnerable to evasion techniques, it is still popular as the first line of defense in antivirus systems. But most of the static analyzers failed to gain the trust of practitioners due to their black-box nature. We propose MAlign, a novel static malware family classification approach inspired by genome sequence alignment that can not only classify malware families but can also provide explanations for its decision. MAlign encodes raw bytes using nucleotides and adopts genome sequence alignment approaches to create a signature of a malware family based on the conserved code segments in that family, without any human labor or expertise. We evaluate MAlign on two malware datasets, and it outperforms other state-of-the-art machine learning based malware classifiers (by 4.49% - 0.07%), especially on small datasets (by 19.48% - 1.2%). Furthermore, we explain the generated signatures by MAlign on different malware families illustrating the kinds of insights it can provide to analysts, and show its efficacy as an analysis tool. Additionally, we evaluate its theoretical and empirical robustness against some common attacks. In this paper, we approach static malware analysis from a unique perspective, aiming to strike a delicate balance among performance, interpretability, and robustness.

- *Cheng Wang, Akshay Kakkar, Christopher Redino, Abdul Rahman, Ajinsyam S, Ryan Clark, Daniel Radke, Tyler Cody, Lanxiao Huang, Edward Bowen*

- `2401.07154v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07154v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07154v1)

> Command and control (C2) paths for issuing commands to malware are sometimes the only indicators of its existence within networks. Identifying potential C2 channels is often a manually driven process that involves a deep understanding of cyber tradecraft. Efforts to improve discovery of these channels through using a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach that learns to automatically carry out C2 attack campaigns on large networks, where multiple defense layers are in place serves to drive efficiency for network operators. In this paper, we model C2 traffic flow as a three-stage process and formulate it as a Markov decision process (MDP) with the objective to maximize the number of valuable hosts whose data is exfiltrated. The approach also specifically models payload and defense mechanisms such as firewalls which is a novel contribution. The attack paths learned by the RL agent can in turn help the blue team identify high-priority vulnerabilities and develop improved defense strategies. The method is evaluated on a large network with more than a thousand hosts and the results demonstrate that the agent can effectively learn attack paths while avoiding firewalls.

<summary>2024-01-15 22:36:56 - The Pulse of Fileless Cryptojacking Attacks: Malicious PowerShell Scripts</summary>

- *Said Varlioglu, Nelly Elsayed, Eva Ruhsar Varlioglu, Murat Ozer, Zag ElSayed*

- `2401.07995v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07995v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07995v1)

> Fileless malware predominantly relies on PowerShell scripts, leveraging the native capabilities of Windows systems to execute stealthy attacks that leave no traces on the victim's system. The effectiveness of the fileless method lies in its ability to remain operational on victim endpoints through memory execution, even if the attacks are detected, and the original malicious scripts are removed. Threat actors have increasingly utilized this technique, particularly since 2017, to conduct cryptojacking attacks. With the emergence of new Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in ubiquitous libraries, widespread cryptocurrency mining attacks have become prevalent, often employing fileless techniques. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of PowerShell scripts of fileless cryptojacking, dissecting the common malicious patterns based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

- *Mousa Tayseer Jafar, Lu-Xing Yang, Gang Li, Xiaofan Yang*

- `2401.11076v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11076v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11076v1)

> The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in recent years has resulted in a significant surge in the number of cyber-attacks targeting these devices. Recent data indicates that the number of such attacks has increased by over 100 percent, highlighting the urgent need for robust cybersecurity measures to mitigate these threats. In addition, a cyber-attack will begin to spread malware across the network once it has successfully compromised an IoT network. However, to mitigate this attack, a new patch must be applied immediately. In reality, the time required to prepare and apply the new patch can vary significantly depending on the nature of the cyber-attack. In this paper, we address the issue of how to mitigate cyber-attacks before the new patch is applied by formulating an optimal control strategy that reduces the impact of malware propagation and minimise the number of infected devices across IoT networks in the smart home. A novel node-based epidemiological model susceptible, infected high, infected low, recover first, and recover complete(SI_HI_LR_FR_C) is established with immediate response state for the restricted environment. After that, the impact of malware on IoT devices using both high and low infected rates will be analyzed. Finally, to illustrate the main results, several numerical analyses are carried out in addition to simulate the real-world scenario of IoT networks in the smart home, we built a dataset to be used in the experiments.

> Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are marvels of technology; celebrated for their prowess in natural language processing and multimodal content generation, they promise a transformative future. But as with all powerful tools, they come with their shadows. Picture living in a world where deepfakes are indistinguishable from reality, where synthetic identities orchestrate malicious campaigns, and where targeted misinformation or scams are crafted with unparalleled precision. Welcome to the darker side of GenAI applications. This article is not just a journey through the meanders of potential misuse of GenAI and LLMs, but also a call to recognize the urgency of the challenges ahead. As we navigate the seas of misinformation campaigns, malicious content generation, and the eerie creation of sophisticated malware, we'll uncover the societal implications that ripple through the GenAI revolution we are witnessing. From AI-powered botnets on social media platforms to the unnerving potential of AI to generate fabricated identities, or alibis made of synthetic realities, the stakes have never been higher. The lines between the virtual and the real worlds are blurring, and the consequences of potential GenAI's nefarious applications impact us all. This article serves both as a synthesis of rigorous research presented on the risks of GenAI and misuse of LLMs and as a thought-provoking vision of the different types of harmful GenAI applications we might encounter in the near future, and some ways we can prepare for them.

- *Md Tanvirul Alam, Romy Fieblinger, Ashim Mahara, Nidhi Rastogi*

- `2401.12790v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12790v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12790v1)

> Concept drift is a significant challenge for malware detection, as the performance of trained machine learning models degrades over time, rendering them impractical. While prior research in malware concept drift adaptation has primarily focused on active learning, which involves selecting representative samples to update the model, self-training has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate concept drift. Self-training involves retraining the model using pseudo labels to adapt to shifting data distributions. In this research, we propose MORPH -- an effective pseudo-label-based concept drift adaptation method specifically designed for neural networks. Through extensive experimental analysis of Android and Windows malware datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in mitigating the impact of concept drift. Our method offers the advantage of reducing annotation efforts when combined with active learning. Furthermore, our method significantly improves over existing works in automated concept drift adaptation for malware detection.

> Neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor poisoning attacks, where the attackers maliciously poison the training set and insert triggers into the test input to change the prediction of the victim model. Existing defenses for backdoor attacks either provide no formal guarantees or come with expensive-to-compute and ineffective probabilistic guarantees. We present PECAN, an efficient and certified approach for defending against backdoor attacks. The key insight powering PECAN is to apply off-the-shelf test-time evasion certification techniques on a set of neural networks trained on disjoint partitions of the data. We evaluate PECAN on image classification and malware detection datasets. Our results demonstrate that PECAN can (1) significantly outperform the state-of-the-art certified backdoor defense, both in defense strength and efficiency, and (2) on real back-door attacks, PECAN can reduce attack success rate by order of magnitude when compared to a range of baselines from the literature.

- `2302.01757v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01757v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01757v3)

> Randomized smoothing is a leading approach for constructing classifiers that are certifiably robust against adversarial examples. Existing work on randomized smoothing has focused on classifiers with continuous inputs, such as images, where $\ell_p$-norm bounded adversaries are commonly studied. However, there has been limited work for classifiers with discrete or variable-size inputs, such as for source code, which require different threat models and smoothing mechanisms. In this work, we adapt randomized smoothing for discrete sequence classifiers to provide certified robustness against edit distance-bounded adversaries. Our proposed smoothing mechanism randomized deletion (RS-Del) applies random deletion edits, which are (perhaps surprisingly) sufficient to confer robustness against adversarial deletion, insertion and substitution edits. Our proof of certification deviates from the established Neyman-Pearson approach, which is intractable in our setting, and is instead organized around longest common subsequences. We present a case study on malware detection--a binary classification problem on byte sequences where classifier evasion is a well-established threat model. When applied to the popular MalConv malware detection model, our smoothing mechanism RS-Del achieves a certified accuracy of 91% at an edit distance radius of 128 bytes.

<summary>2024-01-25 13:26:37 - EvadeDroid: A Practical Evasion Attack on Machine Learning for Black-box Android Malware Detection</summary>

- *Hamid Bostani, Veelasha Moonsamy*

- `2110.03301v4` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03301v4) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.03301v4)

> Over the last decade, researchers have extensively explored the vulnerabilities of Android malware detectors to adversarial examples through the development of evasion attacks; however, the practicality of these attacks in real-world scenarios remains arguable. The majority of studies have assumed attackers know the details of the target classifiers used for malware detection, while in reality, malicious actors have limited access to the target classifiers. This paper introduces EvadeDroid, a problem-space adversarial attack designed to effectively evade black-box Android malware detectors in real-world scenarios. EvadeDroid constructs a collection of problem-space transformations derived from benign donors that share opcode-level similarity with malware apps by leveraging an n-gram-based approach. These transformations are then used to morph malware instances into benign ones via an iterative and incremental manipulation strategy. The proposed manipulation technique is a query-efficient optimization algorithm that can find and inject optimal sequences of transformations into malware apps. Our empirical evaluations, carried out on 1K malware apps, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating real-world adversarial examples in both soft- and hard-label settings. Our findings reveal that EvadeDroid can effectively deceive diverse malware detectors that utilize different features with various feature types. Specifically, EvadeDroid achieves evasion rates of 80%-95% against DREBIN, Sec-SVM, ADE-MA, MaMaDroid, and Opcode-SVM with only 1-9 queries. Furthermore, we show that the proposed problem-space adversarial attack is able to preserve its stealthiness against five popular commercial antiviruses with an average of 79% evasion rate, thus demonstrating its feasibility in the real world.
