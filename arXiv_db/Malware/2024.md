> Context: Cybersecurity vendors often publish cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports, referring to the written artifacts on technical and forensic analysis of the techniques used by the malware in APT attacks. Objective: The goal of this research is to inform cybersecurity practitioners about how adversaries form cyberattacks through an analysis of adversarial techniques documented in cyberthreat intelligence reports. Dataset: We use 594 adversarial techniques cataloged in MITRE ATT\&CK. We systematically construct a set of 667 CTI reports that MITRE ATT\&CK used as citations in the descriptions of the cataloged adversarial techniques. Methodology: We analyze the frequency and trend of adversarial techniques, followed by a qualitative analysis of the implementation of techniques. Next, we perform association rule mining to identify pairs of techniques recurring in APT attacks. We then perform qualitative analysis to identify the underlying relations among the techniques in the recurring pairs. Findings: The set of 667 CTI reports documents 10,370 techniques in total, and we identify 19 prevalent techniques accounting for 37.3\% of documented techniques. We also identify 425 statistically significant recurring pairs and seven types of relations among the techniques in these pairs. The top three among the seven relationships suggest that techniques used by the malware inter-relate with one another in terms of (a) abusing or affecting the same system assets, (b) executing in sequences, and (c) overlapping in their implementations. Overall, the study quantifies how adversaries leverage techniques through malware in APT attacks based on publicly reported documents. We advocate organizations prioritize their defense against the identified prevalent techniques and actively hunt for potential malicious intrusion based on the identified pairs of techniques.

> Defending from cyberattacks requires practitioners to operate on high-level adversary behavior. Cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) reports on past cyberattack incidents describe the chain of malicious actions with respect to time. To avoid repeating cyberattack incidents, practitioners must proactively identify and defend against recurring chain of actions - which we refer to as temporal attack patterns. Automatically mining the patterns among actions provides structured and actionable information on the adversary behavior of past cyberattacks. The goal of this paper is to aid security practitioners in prioritizing and proactive defense against cyberattacks by mining temporal attack patterns from cyberthreat intelligence reports. To this end, we propose ChronoCTI, an automated pipeline for mining temporal attack patterns from cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) reports of past cyberattacks. To construct ChronoCTI, we build the ground truth dataset of temporal attack patterns and apply state-of-the-art large language models, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques. We apply ChronoCTI on a set of 713 CTI reports, where we identify 124 temporal attack patterns - which we categorize into nine pattern categories. We identify that the most prevalent pattern category is to trick victim users into executing malicious code to initiate the attack, followed by bypassing the anti-malware system in the victim network. Based on the observed patterns, we advocate organizations to train users about cybersecurity best practices, introduce immutable operating systems with limited functionalities, and enforce multi-user authentications. Moreover, we advocate practitioners to leverage the automated mining capability of ChronoCTI and design countermeasures against the recurring attack patterns.

> Mobile malware has become one of the most critical security threats in the era of ubiquitous mobile computing. Despite the intensive efforts from security experts to counteract it, recent years have still witnessed a rapid growth of identified malware samples. This could be partly attributed to the newly-emerged technologies that may constantly open up under-studied attack surfaces for the adversaries. One typical example is the recently-developed mobile machine learning (ML) framework that enables storing and running deep learning (DL) models on mobile devices. Despite obvious advantages, this new feature also inadvertently introduces potential vulnerabilities (e.g., on-device models may be modified for malicious purposes). In this work, we propose a method to generate or transform mobile malware by hiding the malicious payloads inside the parameters of deep learning models, based on a strategy that considers four factors (layer type, layer number, layer coverage and the number of bytes to replace). Utilizing the proposed method, we can run malware in DL mobile applications covertly with little impact on the model performance (i.e., as little as 0.4% drop in accuracy and at most 39ms latency overhead).

<summary>2024-01-08 12:52:59 - Survey and Analysis of DNS Filtering Components</summary>

- *Jonathan Magnusson*

- `2401.03864v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03864v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03864v1)

> The Domain Name System (DNS) comprises name servers translating domain names into, commonly, IP addresses. Authoritative name servers hosts the resource records (RR) for certain zones, and resolver name servers are responsible for querying and answering DNS queries on behalf of their clients. Unfortunately, cybercriminals often use DNS for malicious purposes, such as phishing, malware distribution, and botnet communication. To combat these threats, filtering resolvers have become increasingly popular, employing various techniques to identify and block malicious requests. In this paper, we survey several techniques to implement and enhance the capabilities of filtering resolvers including response policy zones, threat intelligence feeds, and detection of algorithmically generated domains. We identify the current trends of each area and find missing intersections in the literature, which could be used to improve the effectiveness of filtering resolvers. In addition, we propose future work designing a framework for filtering resolvers using state-of-the-art approaches identified in this study.

<summary>2024-01-08 17:12:45 - Transcending Transcend: Revisiting Malware Classification in the Presence of Concept Drift</summary>

- *Federico Barbero, Feargus Pendlebury, Fabio Pierazzi, Lorenzo Cavallaro*

- `2010.03856v6` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03856v6) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.03856v6)

> Machine learning for malware classification shows encouraging results, but real deployments suffer from performance degradation as malware authors adapt their techniques to evade detection. This phenomenon, known as concept drift, occurs as new malware examples evolve and become less and less like the original training examples. One promising method to cope with concept drift is classification with rejection in which examples that are likely to be misclassified are instead quarantined until they can be expertly analyzed.   We propose TRANSCENDENT, a rejection framework built on Transcend, a recently proposed strategy based on conformal prediction theory. In particular, we provide a formal treatment of Transcend, enabling us to refine conformal evaluation theory -- its underlying statistical engine -- and gain a better understanding of the theoretical reasons for its effectiveness. In the process, we develop two additional conformal evaluators that match or surpass the performance of the original while significantly decreasing the computational overhead. We evaluate TRANSCENDENT on a malware dataset spanning 5 years that removes sources of experimental bias present in the original evaluation. TRANSCENDENT outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while generalizing across different malware domains and classifiers.   To further assist practitioners, we determine the optimal operational settings for a TRANSCENDENT deployment and show how it can be applied to many popular learning algorithms. These insights support both old and new empirical findings, making Transcend a sound and practical solution for the first time. To this end, we release TRANSCENDENT as open source, to aid the adoption of rejection strategies by the security community.
